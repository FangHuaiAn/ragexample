## Introduction ## 
 When President Richard Nixon entered office in 1969, the United States military was  deeply embroiled in the war in Vietnam. Although the totals had declined slightly  from their peak the previous year, there were still more than 535,000 U.S. troops  in South Vietnam and little prospect of victory.2 The Tet Offensive in 1968, during  which Communist forces suffered 37,000 casualties, was a tactical failure but a  strategic victory for the North Vietnamese. It seriously set back U.S. efforts to pacify  the countryside, terrified the civilian population of South Vietnam, and inflicted  more U.S. casualties than the American public was willing to tolerate. The war was  sparking growing domestic protests and squeezing defense budgets. The diversion  of troops and equipment from Europe to Vietnam and the morale and readiness  problems resulting from years of military operations also reduced the deterrent value of U.S. forces against the Soviet Union. Civilian leaders in the United States adopted a new approach—Vietnamization—that sought to decrease U.S. involvement by  improving and modernizing South Vietnam’s forces so they could assume a greater  share of the burden and allow U.S. forces to withdraw.3 Vietnamization was adopted  as official U.S. policy after a National Security Council review in the spring of 1969.4  Vietnamization represented what later became known as the Nixon Doctrine.  During an impromptu press conference in Guam in July 1969, Nixon outlined his  views that U.S. allies should contribute more manpower for their own defense. The  United States would continue to honor its treaty commitments, including providing  military and economic assistance, and would furnish a nuclear umbrella to its allies,  but would encourage and expect its allies to assume primary responsibility for their  own defense. Nixon explained, “[W]e must avoid the kind of policy that will make  countries…so dependent upon us that we are dragged into conflicts such as the  one we have in Vietnam.”5  While the United States was heavily engaged in Vietnam, the number of Soviet strategic missiles had grown substantially. By 1969, Soviet nuclear warheads  totaled more than 10,500—far fewer than the 27,500 warheads in the U.S. arsenal  but a nearly ten-fold increase from 1960.6 Nixon wanted to change the character  of America’s relationship with the Soviet Union from confrontation to negotiation,  and he sought to initiate talks on strategic arms. A prerequisite for serious strategic  arms limitation talks, however, was the deployment of an antiballistic missile (ABM) system. The Soviets had already begun deploying a system around Moscow; Nixon  believed that if the United States did not have its own system, it would have less  leverage during the arms talks. In 1969, the Senate approved funding for an ABM  system by one vote.7  The approval paved the way for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) in November 1969. The first SALT Treaty was signed in May 1972, in Moscow. The treaty limited  the number of ABM launchers to 200 for each nation, although the number was  halved two years later. The systems would be limited to the defense of the national  capitals and one missile site in each country. The treaty also halted construction of  additional fixed land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launchers and  limited the number of modern ballistic missile submarines and submarine-launched  ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Among the more controversial aspects of the treaty were  the provisions that allowed the Soviet Union more ICBMs and SLBMs than the  United States and the omission of any mention of Multiple Independently Targeted Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs). U.S. critics of the treaty feared that once the Soviets  equipped all of their missiles with MIRVs, their numerical advantage would increase  substantially, enabling greater flexibility and a strategic advantage.8  The emergence of nuclear parity between the superpowers coincided with a decline  in U.S. conventional military capabilities. The war in Vietnam weakened Congressional support for military spending, which impacted force structure. Between  1969 and 1976, the U.S. defense budget decreased by nearly 29 percent in constant  dollars, while active duty endstrength declined almost 40 percent. The number of  tactical fighter squadrons in the Air Force fell from 93 to 69; the number of ships  in the Navy dropped from 885 to 536; the Marine Corps shrunk from 310,000 to  192,000 marines, and the Army contracted from 1,512,000 to 779,000 soldiers. The  cuts restricted the U.S. capacity to project conventional military power.9  In Western Europe, the United States sought to rationalize NATO’s defense investments by convincing European allies to buy U.S. weapons in areas where American  technology was superior, while the Americans would purchase European weapons  when they were better. Several European states agreed to buy U.S. F-16 fighters and  the United States agreed to purchase the Roland II, a Franco-German short-range  air defense system. The United States also pushed NATO to approve a Long-Range  Defense Concept that envisioned a capability to defend Western Europe without  quickly resorting to nuclear weapons. The resultant document, approved in May  1975, placed a “major emphasis” on conventional capabilities but noted that those  capabilities would require only a “modest annual increase in real terms in defense  expenditure” because “NATO has already achieved a large measure of success in this  regard.” In the end, the improvements in NATO defense capabilities were limited.10  Although the SALT Treaty was intended to ease the nuclear competition with the  Soviet Union, the Soviets were no longer the only nuclear-armed U.S. competitor.  China detonated its first nuclear weapon in 1964 and its first thermonuclear weapon  in 1967. By 1969, China possessed approximately 50 nuclear warheads.11 The Nixon  Administration undertook a number of reviews beginning in 1969 to identify  options for dealing with the potential Chinese threat as it decreased the presence  of U.S. troops in Asia. Nixon, however, began to doubt the policy of isolating China over the long term. Skirmishes between Soviet and Chinese forces along the SinoSoviet border in March 1969 gave Nixon an opportunity to exploit the growing  Sino-Soviet split. After another two years of debate within the administration, Nixon  announced on 15 July 1971 that he would visit China in 1972. In the communique  issued at the end of Nixon’s visit, the United States and China agreed to begin moving  toward normal diplomatic relations and not to seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific  region.12  In the Middle East, Egypt and Syria, still smarting from their disastrous defeat at the  hands of the Israelis in the 1967 Six-Day War, launched a simultaneous attack against  Israel on 6 October 1973. The Israelis were caught by surprise and suffered heavy  losses, but committed mobilized personnel and equipment to battle as rapidly as  they reported for duty. After 8 days of fighting, the Israelis had stabilized the Syrian  front and turned their attention to the Sinai. By 24 October, they had moved three  armored divisions across the Suez Canal and cut off the Egyptian 3rd Army from the  remainder of the Egyptian forces.13  Early in the conflict, the U.S. national security establishment came to view the  October War as a potential battle laboratory. It presented a unique opportunity to  collect information on the performance of modern weapons and the effectiveness  of tactics, techniques, and procedures. When Israel realized that it was running out  of critical military supplies, particularly munitions, and turned to the United States  for help, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger demanded a quid pro quo. In exchange  for providing Israel with additional ammunition, fighter aircraft, and other war materials, the United States would have the opportunity to study the war up close shortly  after it ended.14

### 1969–1975

- Marshall: I targeted to talk about the period from September of ‘69 through  January of ‘81. I’m not sure we are going to make it. I think there may be too  much. At any rate, my notes run out a little bit before then. It’s really the period of  the first chunk of my time in government, up essentially to the end of the Carter  Administration.  I thought also that I would go back and say a bit about some important antecedents to this. Now, we’ve covered some of this already, but not in, as I got through  it, as much detail, or things had been left out in the earlier discussion, because  they weren’t, in some sense, intellectually that important.  There’s a bunch of antecedents in my relations with the intelligence community, or the intelligence area. There is this kind of precursor work that I did on net  assessment while at RAND, and then there is this long-term competition set of  ideas. Also it might be worth talking a little bit about my previous involvement in  government [indistinct] stems [indistinct] RAND. A number of these things have  an impact on the bureaucratic strategy I adopted.  So the period, I think, has something like the following breakup to it: From September  of ‘69 to January of ‘72, I was really at RAND, but working a lot for Henry Kissinger  when he was Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. Really about  half time, I think. Also, because James Schlesinger had left RAND in, I suppose,  January of ‘69 to join the Nixon Administration, I was also doing consulting with  Schlesinger at the Office of Management and Budget. And so, you want to cover  some of those kinds of things.  Then there’s the period of January [April] ‘72 through November [October] of ‘73,  when I was actually on the National Security Council staff, and we need to talk  about that. Now, simultaneously with that, Schlesinger left OMB [Eds: Office of  Management and Budget], went to the Atomic Energy Commission, and then  he became the Director of Central Intelligence. And I spent a fair amount of time  talking with him or wrote things for him during that period.  And then, there’s the period of November ‘73 to January ‘81, here in Defense, with  Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld, and Harold Brown.  So I guess I will just talk about some of this and about particularly these antecedents, just to kind of list some things.  The intelligence world: As I mentioned earlier, I had gotten drawn into that by  the work I was doing at RAND quite early because a lot of it was connected with  targeting the Soviet economy. I got very much involved in that.  But probably the most important thing was in ‘52 there had been a request to  RAND from the man, his name was General Millard “Poppy” Lewis, who was the  chief intelligence officer to USAF in Wiesbaden. Among the topics he wanted  worked on was strategic warning. Jim Digby and I were asked to work on that. We  ended up, I ended up spending five months in Germany, in Wiesbaden working  on the strategic warning problem.16 Then in ‘55, ‘56, Joseph Loftus and I, again, were working on the strategic warning  problem, again, for the Air Force. But by that time, the Air Force had created a  worldwide warning system where there were particular nodes. One was in Alaska,  which we went to and stayed a week or so at that. Another was in Japan, and we  spent time there. Also, because of the nature of the information available then, we  spent a lot of time out in the field in various communications intelligence collection centers. And also spent a couple of days, I think, in Hawaii. At any rate, I was  very much involved in the COMINT world; I mean the strategic warning problem.17  Then, in ‘56 [1958], I became a Central Intelligence Agency consultant, which  lasted through to the time I joined the government.  
- Q2: You were no longer at RAND?  
- Marshall: Yeah I was at RAND.  
- Q2: But you were going to work for the CIA?  
- Marshall: Yes, as a consultant, right. Then in ‘57 through maybe ‘63, with Loftus, I ran  this Sovoy project that we talked about before.18  But probably more significant from the connection to the intelligence community  was that when I returned from France, in the spring of ‘65, I was asked to come  and talk with John Bross, who I had not known at all before. I don’t know quite  why he wanted to see me. But, at any rate, we talked, I think probably based  on some of the things that Loftus and I had published about how to improve  estimates and forecasts. Bross had been set up by John McCone [Director of  Central Intelligence, 1961–1965] with something called the office of National  Intelligence Programs Evaluation, the NIPE staff, which was the predecessor of the  Intelligence Community staff, eventually. 19 Bross had been an Office of Strategic  Services officer in World War II. Really one of the “princes of the realm” within the  CIA establishment and clandestine services. He had probably started with a lot  of money, had made a lot of money on Wall Street, married one of the Marshall  Fields daughters. Anyway, he liked me.  There were very few consultants for the NIPE staff. It was quite small, and there  were just two or three consultants, I think. So I came to learn a lot about the  top-management kind of problems from his perspective and advising Richard  Helms [DCI, 1966–1973], who he was a close friend of. That connection continued,  again, also up until the time I joined the government.  So from the early ‘50s on, I had been pretty involved in intelligence, particularly  this connection with Bross was from this period. At any rate, it opened up a lot of  issues and problems to me.  On the net assessment thing, I think I’ve already mentioned the papers I wrote  for Fred Wikner, and probably we will have to go back to the RAND efforts and  locate some papers that I wrote then, Research Memoranda and so on. Wikner  had set up the Net Technical Assessment effort in the Defense Department. It was  probably set up in ‘67, so somehow during ‘68, ‘69, I spent time working on some  problems for Wikner, and I can’t quite remember exactly what I wrote. But then  that’s something we can search in the RAND library.20 Then, in addition, with regard to my previous governmental kind of connections…in ‘57, I was a member of the Gaither Committee staff, and involved with  that from about August through December.21 In ‘58 [Aug–Dec], I was involved  in the preparation and as a member of the delegation that went to Geneva in  connection with the Surprise Attack talks with the Russians.22 Then in ‘61, I was on  a special subgroup of the McCloy arms control study that was set up right after  the Kennedy Administration took over, that looked at nuclear accidents and what  you could do to prevent that. My work for that group went back over the whole  history of the whole series of close calls we had.23  
- Q2: Who was that for?  
- Marshall: It was run out of the State Department, at the time, but the other people  on the thing were—well, I guess Paul Nitze came over to testify—but people like  Marv Stem, Thomas Schelling, me… I forget some of the other people now, but  there were maybe six, eight of us.24  
- Q2: Was that Policy Planning?  
- Marshall: Could have been.  
- Q2: It wasn’t intelligence, it wasn’t the Bureau of Intelligence and Research?  
- Marshall: No, no.  Then in the immediate aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis, I was involved in  some of the efforts to follow what was continuing to go on, but also this issue of  what had the Russians maybe learned from the thing and so on. Then…  
- Q2: That was for the CIA?  
- Marshall: No, that was for Harry Rowen, a Defense Department thing, because  Rowen had come to Washington, along with Charles Hitch and several others  from RAND at the beginning of the Kennedy Administration.25  From August of ‘63 through about March of ‘65, I lived in Paris and was part of a delegation to NATO.26 In the course of that, Rowen had me go head a delegation, make  a couple of visits to Norway, because the Norwegians had approached the U.S.,  wanting kind of bilateral discussions about the defense of Norway.27 In their view, if  you looked at AFNorth [Eds: Allied Forces Northern Europe], and who was supposed  to come to help them, the U.S. was not very well represented in AFNorth at all. Yet the  only people they had any faith in who were ever going to come and help them was  the U.S. So they wanted to open direct discussions about what was really going to  happen, as against purported NATO plans for what was going to happen. So I did that.  And then, in the period around probably ‘66, ‘67 [1965/66], Schlesinger and I were  consultants to Rowen when he was at OMB [Bureau of the Budget]. 28 Some of  it was related to defense, but a lot of it was related to this effort that President  Lyndon Johnson started to try to spread the wonderful cost-effectiveness analysis  to the rest of the government.29 Anyway, Rowen asked us to help on that.  I’ve already mentioned this consulting to Bross from ‘65 through ‘72.  The other kind of antecedent thing that I think is worth talking a little bit about is  the kind of bureaucratic strategy I adopted when I finally did actually get in government, which, on reflection, seems to me to reflect the impact of my interest in  organizational behavior and studies, things I have been thinking about since the  late ‘50s. Based on all of that, I had the view that organizations were pretty hard to  change, and to influence very much, and that timing was very important.  It also, even when I was at RAND, had led me to feel that the RAND way of conveying the results of studies was very poor. In the first place, the studies themselves  were often not very tailored to the organizations that you were really trying to  change. That, in fact, coming out of some of the work that we had done in the  middle ‘60s on organizations, led to this proposal that all RAND studies have an  implementation section where the issue of how we would actually make something happen ought to be addressed. Since, practically speaking, no studies ever  had that, I guess Charlie Wolf coined a phrase for saying that was the “missing  chapter” in all the studies.  Also it seemed to me that very often the pattern was that the study would be  completed, and then the results would be briefed, but be very badly timed with  respect to the acceptability or responsiveness of the organization, and that actually RAND ought to set up a kind of sales department. That the strategy for RAND  ought to be that there ought to be people who focused on the customers and  exploited past work, no matter what its date. Then, the opportunities for really  inserting the ideas arose. 30  It also seemed to me, in my own experience, that letters and memos rather than  the study reports were much more effective than the kind of standard briefings,  the kind of rigmarole that usually went with it.  Anyway, I came into government with the view that the only way to really affect  things was probably either to be a close adviser of somebody who had sufficient  power to actually try to change things—but even then people overestimate what  even people who are supposed to be in charge can do—and that the alternative  was that you had to change people’s minds. And that you could do that, in part,  by changing the way in which they looked at problems, framed problems. Also,  I guess, through Herb Goldhamer I had come to appreciate the importance of  vocabulary in changes in that.  All of this led to the choice with respect to this whole net assessment effort of diagnosis, not therapy, that immediately recommending what to do was not going  to work very well. Secondly, that people ought to think out their own solutions.  Also, it’s worth mentioning that I had been struck by what happened to Alain  Enthoven [Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Analysis] and the whole systems analysis business. One of the ironies is that when the systems analysis stuff  was being thought through and argued through back in the ‘50s, I mean right  from the beginning, after considerable discussion the whole notion was that for  systems analysis, there was a class of issues that it could address and there were  larger, more important issues that it couldn’t. That, in particular, this notion of how  much was enough, or how much you ought to spend on, say, the strategic bombing effort, warfare thing was something that it couldn’t deal with. That people  basically had to assume that there were decisions that were going to be made on some much more general level of broad allocations and that the systems analysis  function was to, within already generally established budgets, to help in spending  it in cost-effective ways.31  When Enthoven came to record the history of his years in the Pentagon, as I say,  it’s very ironic that he should pick the title How Much Is Enough? for the book with  K. Wayne Smith, because that’s precisely what was decided, after long argument,  was not the kind of problem you could actually address.32 But I guess in response  to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara’s demands of whatever, or Enthoven’s  hubris, that’s where it ended up, trying to settle those kinds of questions.  OK. So then let’s go to the beginning of September ‘69 through ‘72, which was this  period I was working for Kissinger.  
- Q2: This notion that notes and memos are more effective than briefings—how do  you square that with, I think, your notion that people don’t read anymore? I mean,  do you give them stuff and then…  
- Marshall: I don’t think they will read long reports. Well, some people obviously do. I  mean…  
- Q2: Harold Brown.  
- Marshall: …or Schlesinger. But the ideal thing is probably to sit down and just talk to  them. But I think that sending them a letter that’s fairly short and makes the simple  points and so on, and is tailored to the occasion, to some problem they might have  and so on, is just a hell of a lot better than some report that comes in the door.  
- Q4: I am most intrigued by the consumer focus here. Your point that you almost do  studies, you stockpile them and then you wait until the opportunity is there to do  something useful.  
- Marshall: Well, you may brief them at the time for whatever good that is, but yes.  So that what a place like RAND tends to offer is all of the past studies, not just the  one which is just coming off the press.  
- Q4: I don’t want to get you off the path of your book, so let me just put a topic on  the table. I think that in this chapter it would probably be very useful to put a couple of paragraphs or a couple of pages to what was happening to the intelligence  organizations that you were starting to deal with at that point in time in their own  evolution. I mean now we are in the 1970s, we are 20 years in the agencies’ formation, you have senior managers who came from the old school, etc., etc., etc.  
- Marshall: Well, yes. We’ll get to that, I think, anyway.  
- Q4: Because it influences both how you affect them and how effective they were  able to…  
- Marshall: Well, as you know, I think the CIA of the ‘50s and early ‘60s is very, very  different from the ‘70s, much to the discredit of the ‘70s.  
- Q4: You could raise a broader issue that whenever you have a new organization,  CIA, you saw it at a certain time, in other…you get these particularly high-quality  people and then they gradually… 
- Marshall: And I think I mentioned that Bross himself was very concerned about  that. I remember him talking to me, talking on the people he already saw in the  late ‘60s. His view was that these people didn’t know anybody else but people in  this agency, and that the people who originally formed it or who were recruited  in the ‘50s, throughout the ‘50s, had a lot of other associations, they knew other  people in the United States and elsewhere. By the late ‘60s, you had the effect of  this career design choice that the Agency made of trying, for security reasons, to  take people right out of universities and have a one-career lifetime. There were  people that spent their whole time in there. The result is that they don’t know  anybody else, I mean in the truly professional way, lack breadth of experience,  and so on, contacts.  OK. So let’s start in September of ‘69. The reason I start the thing there is that in  September ‘69, just before I was going to go off on a long trip to Europe with my  wife Mary, Kissinger called up and said he wanted me to come to see him. I went  to see him on my way to Europe, I stopped in Washington a couple days and it  was then that he told me that he wanted me to come and do what was then, he  thought, a two-month study to look at the flow of intelligence into the White  House. He wanted that done because President Richard Nixon was extremely  dissatisfied with the intelligence coming into the White House. Henry himself was  very, very negative in the way he talked about the thing.33 Evidently, fairly early in  the Administration, Nixon and Attorney General John Mitchell had taken some of  the early National Intelligence Estimates and read them closely, and thought they  were abominable in terms of the writing, the logic, everything. Henry also was  very down on the political analyses. He thought it was worse than that available  in the newspapers, which was lousy. So I agreed to do that, but told him I was  going on this vacation, and…[gap for tape change]  I did that. The pattern of my life at that point was that at least every couple of  years, I would go to France, spend six weeks touring around, having a good time.  So I probably didn’t get back until late in October. And I had these other responsibilities at RAND. I got a couple of nagging phone calls from Al Haig, Kissinger’s  military assistant, asking when was I going to show up and so on. I finally did  show up, and that was essentially the first week in December of ‘69.  I had a long discussion with Kissinger and it was decided that I would do two  studies. One was this study he originally talked about, which was on the flow of  intelligence into the White House—Where did it come from? How did people decide what they were going to send? What could be done to fix that and help that?  The second study was to be a kind of quality report card on intelligence, and after  some discussion, the area that was to be focused on, was that of the strategic  missile forces of the Russians. I began work on those.  The only other thing that is worth mentioning is that in addition to that, I did a  third little study. While I was there—I was there from essentially the first part of  December through the first week of May of ‘70—a coup occurred in Panama. One  of the things that happened immediately was that questions were asked about,  “Who the hell are these guys? What do we know about them?” The answer turned  out to be not a hell of a lot. So Kissinger wanted to know why was that, why didn’t they know more? What was the actual state of the biographic intelligence? So I  looked at that and indeed drafted a kind of guide book about what…you really  want to know about these people. I did read a bunch of things and they were  poor, unless you were thinking about entertaining these people and wanted to  know whether they like scotch or bourbon, and things like that. Not much information there.  So I went to work on that thing, although I was also sidetracked on a couple of things,  like the Russians had just threatened the Chinese and I got involved with, you  know, “What do you think about that? What do we do?” and so on.34 At any rate…  
- Q2: Are you going to say a few words about your studies?  
- Marshall: Yes, right. What I did on the first one about the flow was, I went over to  the Situation Room, which was the focal point for stuff coming in, to find out,  Where did the stuff come from? Then I went and found out, but through interviewing people, talking with them, how each of the organizations decided what  they would send. I suppose the most interesting part of that was, say, the contrast  between the National Security Agency and the CIA. NSA perhaps was favored  by the fact that traditionally the head of the Sit Room staff came from NSA, but  nonetheless, every couple of months, they sat down with that fellow and a couple  of other people, I guess, and went over what were the topics, the areas that  seemed of most interest. Then internally they put out a kind of directive of, “These  are the topics of which material is most wanted,” and they changed it every  couple of months. CIA, in contrast, made no effort to ascertain the areas of most  interest, but, judged by what was in The New York Times to determine the topics.  I don’t know whether they felt very alienated from this administration or what it  was, but they just made no effort. The other thing was that they had this product,  this President’s Daily…report…  
- Q2: Brief? PDB? We called it PDB. We called it President’s Daily Brief.  
- Marshall: Right, which they sent down every day. By the time I had arrived on the  scene, it was very clear that Nixon was not reading it. So the question was, ”Why  the hell are you guys sending it? And how do you decide what you put in there?”  So one of the things that I did was to read in the very early part… I got copies, for  like the first six months of the administration, of that document. Very quickly the  NSC staff had begun to generate a competing daily analysis. So I read all of those.  Also, since Nixon was a person who, if he read anything, almost invariably made  marginal notes, you could tell that fairly quickly he had stopped reading the CIA  product and continued to read from the other one. I also did a statistical analysis  of the degree to which these two things covered the same topics. The NSC one  always had more topics, and the overlap between the two, where they covered  the same topics and so on, was only about 60 percent. It didn’t have so many  more that that’s the reason why there’s more. But at any rate, the point was that  CIA just was not customer-oriented at all. And they also refused to give up. They  understood that they weren’t being read, but it was seen as their premier product  and they weren’t going to give it up.35  
- Q2: Who was doing the NSC one, was it coming out of the Sit Room, or off the NSC staff?
- Marshall: It came out of the NSC staff. I’m sure there were some Sit Room pieces, it  was assembled in the Sit Room, but it was prepared by the regional people just  from that one.  
- Q4: Did you try to do any similar sort of analysis of the flow of information going  from the Sit Room to NSA?  
- Marshall: No, no. So I wrote a report describing the whole thing to Kissinger. And, I  guess, I made a number of suggestions to him. But there wasn’t a hell of a lot that  could be done about that. I told him that as far as I could tell, whatever was there  was really arriving, and that the analysis was awfully poor, which he knew, and  that…  At any rate, I don’t remember that there was anything particularly striking that I  could recommend to him on the quality of the intelligence, which I looked at the  forces, went over what was available, gave it relatively low marks. Of course the  NIEs were part of that, it was not only the daily or weekly sort of things. I remember that one part of the report dealt with what seemed to me the decline of the  old key staff in the Office of National Estimates, which when it started out…  the whole notion of it was that it was to be made up of people largely from the  outside. It would be some people from the intelligence community that would  become parts of the Office of National Estimates, but that retired military guys,  or ambassadors, people from the business world, or academia would be in it. By  the early ‘70s, ‘69, it had become the last stepping stage of retirement. People’s  careers would end within the CIA, not just within the community as a whole and  that it was enough. There was still like a general, maybe somebody from State,  but everybody else was really from CIA. So it had lost its original character, didn’t  on the whole do that great, I mean with analysis.36 And if Henry wanted to change  something, …the quality of things, I mean that’s one thing that needed to be  changed, focused on.  The other thing that I suggested, which led to a follow-on study, was the notion of  picking some part of the Soviet missile program, and, in some sense, by spending  a lot of time directing and advising and so on, to get an exemplary study done.  This led to this special study on the SS-9 and its antecedents. The study was  aimed at trying to understand, “Why does this thing look the way it does? What’s  the whole history? What is the design bureau?” and so on, everything about  it. Also, there were some reasons to believe that the successive generations of  Soviet missiles had been designed to reduce the number of men involved in their  day-to-day functioning and so on. The objective was to do a study that was both  historical and had a bureaucratic cast to it and so on. That study was done and  turned out to be moderately good, not great, but…  
- Q2: And that was your study? I mean you did this study?  
- Marshall: No, I supervised it. After sending in the report in May, I agreed to do that.  So then over the course of the next nine months to a year I supervised that.37  
- Q2: Who was the principal…was this just CIA or the whole intelligence community?  
- Marshall: This was CIA.
- Q2: CIA. And can you say who the CIA person was that was working primarily on that?  
- Marshall: I don’t remember the names. There were some people…But it was a fairly  large effort.  Then what happened was, while I was continuing to do that, Kissinger in the  summer of ‘70, asked Wayne Smith, who had just come on board [indistinct]  taken Larry Lynn’s place—this is the Larry Lynn who went off to the University of  Chicago, who had been in Systems Analysis prior—to do a private, separate study  of program augmentations that might be undertaken if the Soviets misbehaved,  proved recalcitrant, and so on. So Smith assembled a group to do that. That  group consisted of myself, Schlesinger, who was still at OMB, Bill Kaufmann, Fred  Hoffman, Charlie Herzfeld, and Larry Lynn, who was coming back and doing that.  That’s the group that I remember. I think Herzfeld did some stuff on research  and development programs. Kaufmann, I think, did something on tactical forces.  Hoffman did something, I think, on strategic forces. And as the general, broad  background to all of this, Schlesinger and I did what was, in effect, a first net  assessment. Herzfeld very much argued that we should do that. That is, give the  broad background of, here’s what the situation with respect to military balances are, here you have the long-term trends, and so on. Actually, I did most of it  because Schlesinger really didn’t have the time to do that.  Let me mention one thing going back. When I was writing up this thing on the  quality of the intelligence, a delegation of three people, whose names I can’t  remember, came to see me from Defense. These were people who were on the  staff of this Blue Ribbon Panel. They were in the midst of an argument which they  finally resolved in favor of recommending this creation of the net assessment  activity in Defense that was to report directly to the Secretary.38 That was made to  Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird in the summer of ‘70, but he never did anything  about it. They came to lobby me to include in my recommendations to Kissinger  the reestablishment of the net assessment activity at the NSC, which I did not  include.39 It didn’t seem to me that it had to do with the quality-of-intelligence  issue. They had an argument for doing that, which was reasonable in some ways,  but anyway, I didn’t pick that up.  The idea of that came from a panel member who—I tracked back afterwards, and,  again, I can’t think of the guy’s name—had been the chief executive officer of  TRW.40 Anyway, he was on the Blue Ribbon Panel, and he was the person within  that whole committee that argued very much that what the Secretary of Defense  needed was a net assessment group. In fact, under his scheme of things, it was  a net assessment/strategic planning activity that on an organization chart was  drawn as a box to the side with a line directly to the Secretary. He believed that  what was needed was some way of pulling together some comprehensive picture  of what the state of affairs was and where things were going, what the biggest  issues were, and so on. As I say, I later had a talk with him in which I was trying to  understand what motivated him.  At any rate, I did this net assessment thing. In fact, I have a copy of it someplace here.  
- Q2: Did you call it that, “net assessment?”
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q2: Is it still classified?  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q2: Getting about to the point where we might want to think about declassifying that.  
- Marshall: Well, I don’t know. Again, this whole effort was done very quietly, as an  unadvertised thing privately for Kissinger, to provide him with initiatives that he  could, the way he put it, have in his hip pocket.  
- Q2: Well, you probably wouldn’t want to, or you may not want to declassify that  part, but the net assessment part in some sort of way.  
- Marshall: One could look at it, but…  The next thing that happened, as we were just, I think, bringing this effort to a  close, because it started in the summer, was that in December of ‘70, Wayne Smith  reported that Nixon had met with Kissinger and George Shultz, who was then the  head of OMB, and kind of pointed at the both of them and said that he wanted a  study undertaken of the reform of the intelligence community, that he wanted to  make major changes and also wanted to cut the budget 25 percent. I heard later  that one of the things that happened was that he had, I guess while flying out of  Washington on Air Force One, flown over the CIA building and looked down and  saw those huge parking lots and said, “What in the hell are all these people doing? I don’t see anything coming out of this that’s worthwhile.” I don’t know that  that was the whole thing. There were many motives. But at any rate, Shultz put  Schlesinger on this and Smith was asked by Kissinger to form up this effort that  was going to look at this thing.  Smith didn’t have the time, so he asked me, when I’m still at RAND, to be Henry’s  guy on this thing. Of course Schlesinger owned this cell within OMB that followed  the intelligence community, and also had Bill Kaufmann working for him as a  consultant. So most of the work, or a good deal of at least pulling stuff together,  was done by the OMB people. But they were so in the pocket of the intelligence  community that they didn’t in the end have much to contribute about what you  ought to do about these guys.  There was an initial report in March of ‘71 and a final report in September, maybe  a little earlier, probably August of ‘71.41 Then some decisions were made and, I  don’t know who did some initial drafting, but in any case, in the middle of September, I undertook to draft the final kind of decision memoranda, the letters and  memos to Helms and to this one and to that one, Laird, etc.  It all ended in being issued in early November of ‘71.42 Schlesinger by this time  was off at the Atomic Energy Commission. So I wrote the thing and then Haig and  Smith brokered it around, just to see it got acceptability. It was they, somehow,  who inserted a couple of paragraphs about this establishment of a net assessment activity at the NSC and started to lobby me to take that, which I did in January [April] of ‘72. I talked to… well, Bross had been replaced by Bronson Tweedy,  another Establishment figure, also from the clandestine services, who left and ran  the Audubon Society for a while.43 I talked to Tweedy and so I kept him informed as this study went on. But it  became very clear that Helms really, wasn’t seeking any change, didn’t want the  added responsibilities that changes would entail, because under this thing, the  DCI was given a lot of new responsibilities, or old responsibilities which had never  been exercised. And the DCI was then given this Intelligence Community staff to  improve his ability to manage the whole budgeting and direction of the things…  
- Q4: Would it also be fair to say that Helms could see himself ending up in a fight  with the Secretary of Defense?44  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.  
- Q4: Frequently non-political.  
- Marshall: Right. Finally, after spending a lot of time while still at RAND, half in, half  out of the government, I came to the NSC in January [April] of ‘72 for real as a  government official.  
- Q2: Now, did you report to Henry?  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q2: You directly reported to him?  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q2: Where were you located? Where was your office?  
- Marshall: In the Old Executive Office Building. In fact, initially, I had an office that  Admiral Robert Welander, the guy who was cashiered, well, anyway, kicked out of  the NSC because he had this naval enlisted man who had been…  
- Q2: Reporting stuff back to Admiral Tom Moorer in the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman’s  office.  
- Marshall: Yes, right, right. Then I changed, exchanged offices with John Lehman,  who was down in, I forget our final number, but it was like the third floor, like 304  or something like that.  
- Q4: This was originally meant to be a temporary assignment for you, you were  going to be here for just a couple of years.  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q4: And you find yourself getting ensnared in the Washington scene.  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q4: How you managed to maintain your sort of “terrorist” role of upsetting large  bureaucracies over a period of a number of years. So maybe we could explore this  in this book. Or maybe your friends and associates would like to explore it.  
- Marshall: Yes, yes. OK. So I came on board and it was just me initially. Then I got a secretary via NSA, Carol Doheny, and then Lexi Crow, and then I recruited Chip Pickett,  and then later Robin Pirie, Joan Hunerwadel. So there were, I guess, just six of us.  
- Q4: Actually, it was just five, because Carol left. Pickett arrived in early July, and Carol  was not there [indistinct].
- Marshall: We really had two kinds of functions. One of which, on the intelligence  side, really took up by far the most time, because while the thing was called the  Net Assessment Group, I think the reason the thing was created was they wanted  someone to monitor this implementation of this intelligence reorganization. Also,  this reorganization had created an NSC Intelligence Committee that Henry was to  chair, and he needed somebody to staff that and to work that.  And then we were to start up this net assessment function, which turned out to  be difficult, because while Laird had never done anything about this summer  1970 recommendation that he create a net assessment activity, the morning after  this memo came out from Nixon, he created a Director of Net Assessment, who  was given no staff. Wikner was appointed to it, and the whole idea was that he, in  that role, was part of the Secretary’s own office staff, and that task forces would  be set up and there would be no permanent staff of any sort, it would just be ad  hoc’d and so on. In fact, as far as I know, they did absolutely nothing; I mean they  didn’t do any assessments. The one thing that got started, in fact—I guess by  then Wikner had left—was done, not in the Secretary’s office, but under this Net  Technical Assessment group.  Another thing I would mention is, why did I choose Chip Pickett, or how did I  have that happen? Well…In the first place, my notion was, what is the nature of  the problem here? It is to have these organizations change, and therefore I want  somebody who is interested in management, organizations, how to make them  function better. So I went to my friends in the Harvard Business School and said,  “Do you have any recommendations?” I talked to Joe Bower and I talked to C.  Roland Christensen, who were the two people who I knew best.  I had met Bower and then, through him, Christensen, and I had involved the  both of them in a special panel or group that I had put together, probably in ‘67,  when Ivan Selin was the head of Systems Analysis [Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Strategic Programs), OSD Systems Analysis]. Selin had seen some of the  stuff that we had done on organizations of the Russians and so on, Russian military, and he wanted a special look at that. So I recruited Jim March, Christensen,  Bower, and myself to look at what did we really know about the Russian military  organizations, how it was put together, how they functioned. We met several  times in Washington and then wrote a report about what we felt was new, what  could be done in a war, and so on.45  
- Q2: When was that?  
- Marshall: ‘67, I believe.  I can’t remember whether Bower had any recommendation for the NSC Net  Assessment Group, but Christensen had two. One he mentioned, a person who  was already in Washington, who I think was in the government, but might want  some other position. I talked to him, he was a very engaging fellow, but really  wasn’t interested. He wanted to leave government and make some money and so  on. The second recommendation was George [Eds: “Chip”] Pickett, who had the  advantage of being in the Army, an intelligence officer already, who was about to  graduate from Harvard Business School, and who might be the first. So I talked to  George Pickett and decided I wanted George Pickett. So then, I guess the main thing to talk about… I mean, again, with so much of this  it’s hard to say that it has much to do with intellectual development.  
- Q2: What’s that?  
- Marshall: I mean if this is an intellectual history…  
- Q2: No, I think it is. I think it is a collection of people and why…  
- Marshall: No, no, I understand that. I understand.  
- Q4: Tell me another thing. I kind of like the shaping issue, sort of what was going on.  At that point in time Bower was teaching this course in business policy, and Bower,  who started out as— He wrote his dissertation on financial analysis and capital  investment in some industries, and what he did was find out that the bureaucratic  interpretation of that phenomena was better than a financial interpretation, and  wrote a book on it. The other thing is that he had the draft chapters from the  Essence of Decision, decision-making during the Cuban missile crisis.46 And that  was assigned reading in his course. It turned out that the vast majority of the  students in the class really didn’t like those chapters. They didn’t find that it was  very relevant as a framework for analysis. There were some who were absolutely captivated by it. So there really was sort of an accidental— The point is that,  even the business world at this point was beginning to capture and teach their  students the whole issue of how administrative behavior and what it meant, and  how one had to think about it, more than just simply [indistinct].  
- Marshall: Well, Bower had been one of the participants in that…  
- Q4: The Ernest May study.  
- Marshall: …the May Group that I talked about last time. Right.  
- Q2: You want to say a few words about why you picked Robin Pirie? How?  
- Marshall: I picked him, I guess, on the advice of Pat Parker, who had been in Systems Analysis with him and told me Pirie had come a cropper of the Admiral, I  guess, Hyman Rickover, and would be available. I interviewed him. I think it was  kind of Parker’s recommendation, early availability, and so on.  
- Q2: So he was still in the Navy then?  
- Marshall: Yes, oh yes.  
- Q2: I mean, he didn’t get out as a result of this problem with Rickover or anything?  
- Marshall: No, no. One of the things I found when I got to the NSC was that while  they said I could have so many people, it was also clear that I had to get some  people for free, which people like the two of them were. The other people…  
- Q4: They had to come out of your budget.  
- Marshall: …were on the payroll.  
- Q4: There’s another point that is sort of a subtext. You made a statement many times  in the past that when new intellectual disciplines are developed, they sort of are  formed and certainly begin to see their formation in groups, in academia. And if  the agencies were doing their job, what you would do would be to penetrate, and I don’t mean that in the negative sense, penetrate the academic community and  find out who was beginning to think about these subjects long before they were  written about. And the issue of organizational behavior, administrative behavior  was one of those aspects.  
- Q2: Was there a specific problem that you saw putting Pirie on, the way you saw  putting Pickett kind of on this organizational…  
- Marshall: No. I thought that Pirie would be the person who would spend most of  his time on the assessment activity, while Pickett and I would be the main people  working on the intelligence business. Then, as I have already mentioned, the net  assessment thing took a long time to germinate, because we had to just overcome  a lot of bureaucratic obstacles, because Laird just didn’t want to do anything to  cooperate in any way. I think the most interesting stuff that came out of the work  that Pickett and I were doing was in connection with this NSC Intelligence Committee. One of its functions was to provide feedback and appraisal of the performance of the intelligence community in meeting the requirements of the top-level people. So we undertook several case studies, one set of which had dealt with  crises that had occurred, for which we were trying to understand the adequacy of  the intelligence community support to decision-makers in the crisis periods. Out  of that came one of the biggest lessons I felt that I learned, which was that when  we set these task forces to work to look over the past—Chip kind of shepherded  most of these, we put them to work under somebody—the first version of the  report always was, “All things considered, the intelligence community…”  
- Q2: …did a damn good job.  
- Marshall: Yes, right. Then you had to go back and forth and finally you learn that  things weren’t so hot. I just came away with the feeling that there was an enormous gulf that separated the people in the intelligence community from the  top-level people, certainly from Kissinger and Nixon. The two groups of people  had a totally different view of the world and what the nature of the crisis was,  what the stakes were. And so, if you put these people to work to try to grade the  thing, they came up with these good grades, and it took some time for them to  even see that maybe things had not gone as well as they thought. Later, when  I used to give some talks to mid-term training sessions of the Agency people, I  used to tell them that I thought the situation was a little bit like: Here’s a chessboard, and there are a couple of players at the board, and they have a set of  advisers. The problem with the advisers is that they don’t know what the game is  about, what the moves of the pieces are. 47  I think in several cases it was very clear that for Kissinger and Nixon, how things  came out mattered more than it did for some people who seemed to feel that  people are dying, we have to end this thing as soon as possible, almost any terms  will do; whereas people like Kissinger and Nixon saw crises as opportunities, as  well as problems that had arisen that had to be terminated as soon as possible.  Also, they had goals, like U.S. prestige and so on, that these other people had very  little interest in, as far as I could see. There was even a case, I forget which of the  ones, probably the India-Pak crisis, or something like that, where the question was  asked, and the reply back from the CIA was so poor—in fact I talked to the CIA people later about it. Whereas people like Nixon and Kissinger cared a lot about  the details of the outcome and worried about long-term consequences, these  other people thought there were no long-term consequences, so that the question that had been posed was one that their response didn’t answer at all. So you  just have this difference that has to be taken account of and maybe you correct.  The other thing I remember was we took a look at Yugoslavia, to look at the political and economic analysis, and convened a set of people. I remember Nathan  Leites was involved in looking at some of it, and I got Joe Kircheimer involved in  comparing the analysis of the Wall Street banks with the intelligence community’s  analyses. Nathan’s view, I remember, was, “Why don’t they translate and circulate  the best articles from German and Swiss newspapers? They’re much better than  anything they do.” On the economic side, the comparison was very much to the  detriment of the intelligence community.48 Again, you come away with the view  that there is just a lot of expertise and knowledge out in the world, and a lot of it  is better, more relevant than stuff these guys produce. And they ought to be in  the business of mining that more than they are.  Then we had the great good fortune that while we were there at the NSC we had  another big crisis. The Yom Kippur War occurred. One of the things that we had  found when we tried to find out, in fact, what various estimates people had even  read, or taken any account of, in doing the earlier cases— When the war started,  I set Pickett to work, and he started interviewing people while the war was going  on, to try to understand the relationship, and the performance of the intelligence  community. Pickett wrote a very thick, really terrific study. I think two copies were  sent out, one to Kissinger, who was then at State, and one to Schlesinger over at  the Defense Department. I have no idea what has ever happened to any of those.  
- Q4: The Net Assessment staff were, however, banned from talking to the Defense  Intelligence Agency.  
- Marshall: Yeah. Right.  
- Q4: Interesting set of stories there.  
- Q2: Did you keep a copy?  
- Marshall: I don’t know, we had a copy for a while. I don’t know where it is now.  The thing to comment about is the reactions of the Agency during this period.  When I first came on board, Edward Proctor [Deputy Director for Intelligence] and  others came down, pledging great cooperation, support, and everything, which  quickly evaporated, I would say. Had a very, very poor response. It was kind of  like my final disenchantment with these people, my feeling of how badly they  compared, I think, to people that were there in the ‘50s and early ‘60s. Often the  failures were just so obvious, but they never seemed to learn.  I remember one of the first things that happened when I was there, and I think it  happened prior to Pickett’s arrival, was that Kissinger had asked for a special study  on the Chinese missile program, to make doubly sure that we really understood  the Chinese missile program. There came back a report which said, “Everything is  fine. We have multiple satellites up already, and when we get a new one up it’s going to even be better. And we, with high confidence, can tell you that they  don’t have any missiles, yet.” A few months later, it became clear they had missiles,  that we had been missing them. In fact, one of the reasons given for why we were  sure they didn’t have them was precisely the reason we had missed them. The  reason for absolute surety was that with both we and the Russians, the people  who supposedly know the only way to do things, you have these things where  you have versions of the way you’re going to deploy them at the test sites, and  then you see exactly what they look like, I mean the silos or this or whatever,  the launching pads and so on, and then you are able to look and find them  when they start deploying. Nonsense. That’s not the way the Chinese did it. They  obviously from the beginning had put a lot of emphasis on not being detected  very easily. So some evidence appeared, as I say, a few months afterwards which  showed they had them. Then when they went back, they were able to find them  four or five years earlier. And yet, it never teaches them anything, as far as I can  tell.  
- Q4: This is the group that when the Arab-Israeli war breaks out in October, it got off  at about four o’clock on Saturday morning, at nine o’clock on Saturday morning  in the Pentagon the strategic warning staff meets, this is the [indistinct] operation. And they have a debate that goes on from nine until 11 or 12 o’clock in the  morning, and at that point they issued the DCI’s official position that this is not a  war, but simply a minor skirmish that is occurring and the Arabs and Israelis will  go away.  But I think there is a theme that you want to sort of file away to raise. I think, maybe you disagree, there is this period between say 1967 and ‘69 on the one hand  and, say, 1975, where lots of sort of major institutional traumas take place to the  intelligence community, and I would guess probably the strongest period of sort  of shock change to the organization. One of which is Schlesinger becomes DCI.  He’s the first outsider as the DCI. But then there’s a whole bunch of other things.  The failures in Vietnam intelligence and all the controversies…  
- Q2: The Church committees…  
- Q4: Two committees in the middle part of the ‘70s just absolutely blow apart the  insulation of the intelligence community from the Congress and permanently set  it aside.  
- Marshall: Yeah, yeah, right.  
- Q4: And there are a bunch of things we can talk about…  
- Marshall: Well, again, obviously we can come back to this later, but the CIA was a  complete flop on the Soviet economic things, the defense burden, which was  something I’ll come back to a little later. Also indicative of the situation was that  Kissinger was very interested in one of the products they produced, which were  these psychological profiles that Jerry Post and some people out there did. 49  They were seen by the rest of the intelligence establishment as sort of very low  products, I mean not our first-line estimates. And yet Kissinger very much wanted  them, valued them, and you had to have a big fight with them to get them to  really produce them, to do more than they were doing. Another thing was that we wanted to get them to attach probabilities to their  predictions, first to give alternative outcomes, not just one outcome as a forecast,  and secondly, to attach probabilities. That was a great trauma for them and you  never succeeded in dealing with it. During this period, RAND had been doing  some work on a thing that’s technically called “reproducible [reproducing] scoring  systems.”50 It’s a way of assigning a score for how close you are to the right answer  that provides an incentive for someone supplying an estimate to provide, in fact,  his best estimate, not to play games with the receiver of the thing. They had developed a really neat device of multiple-answer questions with three answers. They  had developed it, as a demonstration, for a whole series of different fields, like  Roman history or 17th-century music, or various kinds of things. The virtue of it  with the three potential answers was that with a light pen you could register your  relative probabilities among the three by the point on this triangle, the area of  this triangle that you could get. If A, if you were 100 percent sure, you put it at…  Why don’t we get back to that, I guess. Alright, maybe we just ought to take that up,  the transition of Net Assessment from the NSC staff to the Defense Department. The  main thing to say about the transition, I think, would be that Kissinger in the summer  of ‘73 had been appointed the Secretary of State and had the two jobs, but he was  beginning to spend more and more of his time over at the State Department. I  guess this all happened at the same time that Schlesinger came to Defense. I guess  he actually arrived on the 2nd of July. Fairly soon afterwards, he called me, and  called me every week or two about coming over and setting up a net assessment  office in Defense. I had been somewhat hesitant about doing that. In the first place,  I wasn’t sure I was going to stay in Washington—ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Secondly, Mary  for various reasons was against it and so on. But then what happened was really  a negotiated deal with Kissinger to transfer the whole office, not just that I would  come over and start over again, but that the whole office and responsibility for  net assessment, national net assessments would be transferred with me to Defense.  
- Q2: Who negotiated that?  
- Marshall: Schlesinger and Kissinger between themselves. So that’s what happened.  In fact, someplace around here there probably is a National Security Study Memorandum that transfers the thing.  
- Q2: NSSM 186?  
- Marshall: No, no, there’s several NSSMs. There’s a NSSM that sets up the NSC net  assessment process, which probably came out in the early part of ‘73, when we  finally reached agreement about how we were going to proceed with net assessments from that point on, which was that they would be formulated through  some process at the NSC level, with consultation and so on of the departments,  and then they would be assigned to some department to carry out, depending  on the character or focus that they would have. So there was a NSSM on that.51  Then there was a NSSM, NSSM 186—that’s where Project 186 got its number—  which was the first net assessment that was to be done, which was on ground  forces.52 It wasn’t completed until I came over to the Defense Department, when  it was conducted or headed on the government side by Pat Parker, who went to  work for, I forget the name of that fellow who was hissuperior, who… 
- Q4: Not in Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence? Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence?  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q2 or Q4: Parker.  
- Marshall: Yeah. Then there’s another NSSM [NSDM—National Security Decision  Memorandum] which transfers responsibility. That’s later. To kind of sum up this  NSC period, I would say— Well, let me go back before doing that.  One of the other things that happened, of course, in this period was that Schlesinger became the DCI. I sent him a letter, handwritten, so I don’t have a copy of it, telling him what I thought the problems were that he was going to face. I remember  the opening sentence or two says, “You’re taking over an organization with very  low morale that compares unfavorably with the people in the ‘50s.” I made the  point that then they were very activist, sought outside help, worked long hours;  now it’s become a routine eight-to-five job for these people. They seem uninterested in anybody else’s information or knowledge, and so on. Schlesinger later  told me, “You certainly were right about that.” He said, “You could get trampled on  the stairways at 4 o’clock. I don’t know why they put lights in this building.”  The other thing about Schlesinger, that was already mentioned, was that he was  the first DCI from outside of the Agency. Well, that’s not right. McCone had been  from the outside.  
- Q4: McCone?  
- Marshall: Yes, he was a businessman.  
- Q4: But no intelligence experience in the war?  
- Marshall: No, I don’t think so. At any rate, Schlesinger just scared them. In fact, there  were a bunch of the middle managers, including Proctor, who just hid when he  was out there. It’s hard to know exactly why he was so frightened.  
- Q4: Well, his personality, as I recall, would lead one to feel that way. He did not tolerate fools, to put it mildly.  
- Marshall: Yeah. He did, of course, even before he went out there… Well, in the first  place, let me just mention another part of the story. He and I had been talking for  some time because, while he took over in, I think, February of ‘73, right after the  election in ‘72, Nixon went up to Camp David, and then called the various heads  of agencies up there. He called Helms and, at least second or third hand, told him  he was not going to be continuing.53 When Schlesinger came up there, to talk  about the Atomic Energy Commission, which he was head of, he was told that he  was going to take over. So he and I began talking right after that; this happened  right after Thanksgiving. In December, he and I started talking about what do you  do with this place, who are the good guys, and various things.54 As I say, I wrote  him this longish letter about the situation and things I thought that needed to  be done for long-term goals. Then when he initially took over, I started spending  weekends up there, meeting with him, helping him [indistinct].  
- Q2: Not literally the whole weekend? 
- Marshall: No, Saturdays. Then later when he took over as SecDef, I again wrote him  something, and there’s a three-, or four-, or five-page thing that’s around, somehow that got typed up and there are copies around, about my perspective on…a  longer-term look at the world and where things had [indistinct], issues that he  ought to think about, and so on.55  To come back to this period from the NSC. The first thing I would say is my impression ended up that Kissinger, even going back to the initial studies he had me do  and then this monitoring of the reorganization of the intelligence community and  so on, that he fundamentally was not interested in all that. He was doing it, I think,  because Nixon wanted something done. I think Kissinger thought the intelligence  products were terrible, but he is not someone who is at all focused on improving  organizations, changing organizations, making them better. His view, I think, of  the NSC was, “We can get what we want out of the intelligence organizations, for  the most part, so why do we care?” Schlesinger had a totally different view. Wherever he went he was very interested in the organization and changing or making  it better.  In fact, that may be one of the big distinctions among officials, one way of thinking about the people who come into government. That is, there are some people  who just want to do as well as they can during the couple of years they are there  and are interested in performing well, or seeming to perform well. But they are totally uninterested in the organizations or the processes. Then there’s a set of guys  who are really interested in trying to change things or make them better.  The other thing is to look back at the performance of the intelligence community.  Just really bad. Let me give you another example. I remember being called over  and going into the Situation Room. Then Carl Duckett [CIA Deputy Director for  Science and Technology] came down to break what was really bad news. In the  negotiations with the Russians, we had put a lot of emphasis with respect to the  SS-19, about what its size or volume could be and there were some specific provisions in the treaty.56 Those provisions had been guided by past Agency estimates  of what the volume or size of the SS-19 was. Duckett was there to tell us that the  calculations had been wrong. There was an error in them that had not been  detected for several years. It had been there for years. It was a simple thing of  some number had been divided by another number rather than the square root  of the number, or some damn thing of this sort. At any rate, the -19 was bigger,  very likely bigger, enough bigger that it would cross this threshold that was set  in the SALT I treaty. So if the Russians signed it as they probably did, or would, or  had—I can’t remember the date—they were already in violation of the thing, or  they were intending to violate it. I remember Haig and I and, I forget, there were a  couple of other people who were in there… I recall Haig being pretty upset about  it all. But again, it was just symptomatic that here’s this organization, probably the  TRW guys had made this mistake, nobody in the Agency had ever checked the  calculations or knew enough to check the calculations. Now, this in effect… not  real serious…  
- Q2: Does this relate to the SS-13, and that the -19 could only be so much bigger  than the -13 and there was an error on the size of the -13 or something like that?
- Marshall: No, this, as far as I remember it, was that we had an estimate of what the  -19 was, and the whole thing was an issue of trying to constrain…  
- Q2: You could only grow so much in volume.  
- Marshall: Yes, that’s right. The point was that it was already bigger than that. And  you had spent based on their estimates, had negotiated this set of constraints.  
- Q4: And we had it wrong.  
- Marshall: And we had it wrong.  
- Q4: Is this the -9 or the -19?  
- Marshall: No, it’s the -19.  
- Q4: It was how much it could grow depending upon whether they became big  missiles or small missiles.  
- Q2: This is a modernization issue and it had to do with the -19, which was not yet  deployed, but was coming down the road, and I think was a modernization to the  -13.  
- Marshall: Yeah, could be.  
- Q2: Then the issue was how much could it grow. And there was this error in calculations that I had known about, I mean I didn’t know about this thing, there was  this error in calculation, but I had thought it was based upon our estimated size of  the -13 so that therefore the projected growth meant the -19 could be so big, but  we were wrong about the size of the -13, which meant that the -19 was going to  break the limit.  
- Marshall: It could be. My memory is not that good. It could be.  
- Q4: But the main point of it was that it was rotten arithmetic.  
- Marshall: Yeah, but the point was that it was one of these things where the arithmetic was wrong. And nobody had ever checked it; it had been around for several  years.  
- Q2: Now, Henry had one of those, too, where his arithmetic was wrong, on equivalent megatonnage, as I recall, because it’s the megatonnage to the two-thirds and  he was doing the square root and I don’t know where he got that from.  
- Marshall: Yeah, right. I guess one of the fun things about this period was the raising-of-the-Soviet submarine project.  
- Q4: Glomar Explorer.  
- Marshall: Yep. An interesting reflection: I talked with Schlesinger about it because  there was a set of issues about whether to go forward with it.57 And it goes back  to an idea, which we’ll maybe get into, of Schlesinger’s, and mine, too, this business of thinking about things you do in terms of their impact on other people,  on your opponents. His view was, yes, this is risky, but from time to time the U.S.  should pull off some real exploit, just to shake up the other guy.  
- Q4: To keep them unbalanced. 
- Marshall: And this is sort of, therefore, the right kind of thing to do, not only for  its purported immediate payoffs that you get, but its perceptions, psychological  aspect of things.  
- Q4: Is this the period in which you were doing, they did the work on the anomalies,  the 56, the 58 anomalies, whatever we called them. This is the things that the  Soviets are doing which we can’t find an adequate explanation for.  
- Marshall: Yes, I think that work was going on, and Herzfeld was much involved in  that kind of thing. Yeah, I think so.  Anyway, the period, though, is kind of crazy, all this arms control nonsense going  on. When you see it up close and see how irrational it all is, and how subject it is  to these problems like this arithmetic about the size of the -19. And also, arms  control has the problem of controlling some dimensions of things that don’t have  any impact on anything at all.  
- Q2: Or have negative impact.  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.  
- Q2: They just don’t figure out what they’re trying to fix.  
- Marshall: Right. No chance of [indistinct].  
- Q2: Like sausage. The more you see, the less…  
- Marshall: Right.  Let’s talk a little bit about the Schlesinger period here and this transition.  Schlesinger and I sat down and talked, once I got here, about what areas he’s  particularly interested in having some assessments done. There were three: the  NATO-Warsaw Pact balance, the strategic forces balance, and the maritime balance. So we started off to do things in all those areas.  
- Q2: Who did you have working on those?  
- Marshall: I think that at that point, well, Chip Pickett started off on the NATOWarsaw Pact.  
- Q4: When Marshall came over to the Pentagon he took Robin Pirie with him, actually moved everybody in the office except one, and there was just the same office  replicated here. It was that way until…Lee Badgett?  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q4: …joins in the middle of ‘74, something like that.  
- Marshall: Right.  
- Q2: And he was a Navy guy, right?  
- Marshall: Air Force.  
- Q2: He was here to do the strategic forces?  
- Marshall: Well, no. He came and because of his background, he was really more  associated with the Soviet military budget and that sort of thing.  
- Q4: He came from the Air Force Academy faculty? 
- Marshall: Yes. And then James Roche replaced Pirie.  
- Q2: When was that?  
- Marshall: ‘75, the middle of ‘75, or spring of ‘75.  
- Q4: Robin retires and goes to the Congressional Budget Office or something.  
- Marshall: Right, yeah. Then we have some additional thing, I guess Peter Sharfman  is the next one.  
- Q4: No, I think Bob Sorley comes in …  
- Q2: To replace Pickett?  
- Q4: …late. No, because he arrives, Sorley must arrive after Jim. Pickett leaves the  summer of ‘76, Sorley must be there for six to nine months before then…  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q2: Did he pick up the NATO stuff?  
- Q4: I think, yeah, well, he was only there…  
- Marshall: But Sharfman came, because in the spring of ‘76 he was involved in these  Israeli talks. Toward the fall, we started meeting twice a year with them.58  
- Q2: I thought Roche did those.  
- Marshall: He and Sharfman.  
- Q2: Oh, they both did.  
- Marshall: Anyway, Sharfman took over the strategic things. At some point, Fred  Giessler shows up.  
- Q2: But when you first started out, Schlesinger wanted these three studies. You had  Pickett working NATO-Warsaw Pact. Who was working strategic forces?  
- Marshall: Me, I guess.  
- Q2: And then Pirie did the maritime balance?  
- Marshall: Yeah, started that.  
- Q2: And then you did strategic forces. Who did you finally hand that off to?  
- Marshall: I handed it off to Sharfman.  
- Q4: But it doesn’t get handed off for probably two years or more.  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q4: Part of that is that nobody had…nobody in the office had his depth. So the  others were kind of…the two of them, kind of going along after him, trying to  keep him supported.  
- Q2: So Sharfman comes on board in ‘75.  
- Marshall: I think late ‘75.  
- Q2: After Roche.  
- Marshall: Yeah, probably. 
- Q2: But before Sorley.  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.  
- Q4: You have to check the dates. I’m just not sure.  
- Marshall: Yeah, right. You’d have to check those and so on.  OK, so we are doing these. We basically have three fundamental tasks. One was  to do these assessments for the Secretary, proprietary assessments to him. Then  the idea was that we were going to try to stimulate each of the Services to create  a net assessment activity. The only one that succeeded was the Navy. The Army  didn’t do anything, they created a point of contact, which was Ed Vandiver. The Air  Force didn’t do anything except some special projects later, around ‘76, ‘77.  Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Chief of Naval Operations, created a net assessment  activity.  
- Q2: Who headed that?  
- Marshall: Later it’s Bill Manthorpe, but earlier it was this fellow who had a heart  attack and died, didn’t die but [indistinct]. Yeah, you’d have to go back, right.  At any rate, the third thing was to undertake a development program of tools,  methods, databases, and so on.  In addition to these formal things, Schlesinger used me a lot as an intermediary  with the intelligence community. Soon after he came here, he called Proctor down  and said, “I just find it hard to believe that the Soviet military effort consists of six  percent of their gross national product. Will you go take another look at that and  tell me why any reasonable man should believe that?” When I came, he told me  about that and then we had some further meetings. Then they finally decided they  were going to write something and look at it, and they came back with a paper that  was totally unconvincing, that said the most it could be is, like, about one percent  off in either direction. Then in ‘76, of course, they… they’d known about it for  about a year, but in ‘76 they had to change it and move it up to 12 to 13 percent.  And I have the paper, the memos that I wrote for Schlesinger back to them.59  
- Q2: What forced them to raise it?  
- Q4: Oh, it was the inflation rate.  
- Marshall: No, what forced them to raise it was an emigre who came out, who had  seen some books that were convincing to them.60 Plus, when they went and did  some work on the dollar-ruble exchange rates for some selected systems that  they had some evidence on, they decided that they had been way off for modern  systems.61  
- Q2: So that’s in ‘76 that they raised it to 12 percent?  
- Marshall: Yeah, I think early ‘76.62  
- Q4: What I thought was interesting about then, and I was really on the periphery  of it, was that there had to be some sort of seminal event, one, two, or three that  would force this estimate, and these people to make a change. There would have  to be an emigre who came and said, “I actually saw the books and it’s wrong,” or there was some very sensitive intelligence information in several cases that  would enable them to get a window of insight, which was not a random sample  window, but it was a window. And they have to go back and question themselves.  But they couldn’t bring themselves to go about doing it on their own.  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q4: One of the problems with the community, it could not…it needed an external  stimuli that was sort of uncontroversial in its implications.  
- Marshall: In some ways, there’s not a lot to talk about, I think, about the Schlesinger  period, in the sense that, the period of startup…Well, there is one other thing. As I  mentioned, we had started this assessment on the ground forces. One of the first  things that we did when we got here was to take over responsibility for that and  having it finished. When the final report was being prepared, and we’d not had  much to do with it up to that time…  [gap for tape change]  …it called for a listing or discussion of the strengths and weaknesses on both  sides. When it came to the final thing, the intelligence people, the DIA guys,  simply would not put down any weaknesses on the Soviet side. At one point  they had made the preposterous explanation that, yes, they might have some  weaknesses, but even if they did exist, they would notice them and fix them, so  that it wasn’t worth talking about them or taking much notice of them. I remember saying to them, “Would that that were so about our weaknesses.” So it was  resolved, finally, by Lt. Gen. Danny Graham, who had just taken over DIA. And  talking with him… Danny and I had gotten to know one another, I guess, while  I was still at the NSC. We had talked a lot about Soviet weaknesses, so he wasn’t  in any position to say that the Soviets didn’t have any weaknesses. So he got it  changed. But it’s just symptomatic of these people. The constant weakness of the  intelligence community, this unwillingness to really deal with, or to have an intelligent assessment of the opponent’s weaknesses.  
- Q4: Let me give you an example. There were a whole set of four or five myths that  they had about the Soviet Army. One of which was that the Russians are stupid  because they design the T-62 tank and only somebody who was less than about  six foot, five foot-eleven, or something like that could fit into it. And they made  a big play out of it. And there was in a meeting with one of these intel guys and  a couple of people from the Army made this comment, and Pickett said, “Pardon  me, but do you have demographic data on the average height of the Soviet  male?” “Well, yes we do.” “What is it, what is the average height of the Soviet  male?” “Probably about 5-foot-6.” And Pickett said, “So are they designing the  tank…” Pickett said, “What is the height of a male who can climb in the Army M-  60?” And the answer was 6-foot-4. And Pickett said, “Where is that on the height  distribution?” Guy on the Army staff said, “It’s on the 99th percentile.” Pickett said,  “Shall we go back and try this all over again about who is stupid?” And it was just  these… the guys who were doing [indistinct] analysis for the Defense Intelligence  Agency, had just a very narrow focus on that. It was just absolutely phenomenal.  And there are other stories. 
- Marshall: Yes. The other thing to say about this period is—I guess we talked about  it before, the last time—that one of the things that Schlesinger was very interested in, and, in fact, both of us were because we had talked a lot about it back  at RAND, was this whole aspect of the political-psychological impact or use of  military forces, their role beyond fighting, or getting your way without fighting by  looking impressive enough, and so on. I think we’d both been interested in that. I  had been interested in that going way back because of Goldhamer and Leites and  so on. Something that was very important for both Schlesinger and I, while we  were both at RAND, was reading Robert Ardrey’s The Territorial Imperative, which  immediately raises the issue of the nonrational aspects of man and his behavior.63  Our interest was based partly on an obvious fact of history, that coercion and  display of forces and so on are used to gain your ends without fighting, and also  on the possibility that this is not just a matter of, you show up and the other guy  does a set of calculations and so on, but that there are other mechanisms at work  and that you ought to understand that and so on.  So one of the other things I did for Schlesinger, after sort of getting on board,  was to start this whole program of work on perceptions and so on. Now, actually,  when I was working for Henry, I had already started down this road by making a  request to the Agency—again, Henry was a naturally interested party in this kind  of thing—and so we… Remember this Bob Levine?  
- Q4: Um-hum.  
- Marshall: So we assigned this one guy to do this work. The idea was to try to look  at everything we could find from the Soviets to find out: “What is it that they pay  attention to about us? What sorts of things seem to give us high scores in their  books? What things don’t matter or give us low scores?” In other words, how can  we then start to do those things or show those characteristics which impress  them and influence their assessments?  When I got here, Schlesinger was very, very interested in this. It was one of his  absolutely fundamental views about things. So I started this work. I got some  money from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Stephen Lukasik  was the head of DARPA then, and I think, probably, Schlesinger had called him.  So I went over, and one of the first projects we started was the stuff that started  out at RAND with Herb Goldhamer in charge. There was a meeting at RAND.64  That’s when I first met Lionel Tiger, but I had read his book before that. I had read  both Men in Groups and The Imperial Animal. Men in Groups probably came out in  around ‘70 or ‘69, or something like that [1969].65 The Imperial Animal came out  in ‘73 [1971].66 We invited him and a bunch of others and started off this whole  series of things.  
- Q2: Who was it— You said RAND was taking the lead on this?  Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q2: Who was doing it there?  
- Marshall: Herb Goldhamer. And he continued on with a whole bunch of things up  to the time he died. 67 The other thing to say about this period is, again, this kind of contrast between  Schlesinger and Kissinger. Kissinger, I think, really had a very pessimistic view of  America’s future. He really did, and at that time, given what the hell was going on  in this country, one had some rights to be pessimistic. But Schlesinger wasn’t at  all. [Indistinct] In fact, I think one of the most interesting things that Schlesinger  ever said—I think it was in some Time magazine [11 Feb ‘74] article—which I think  people never understood very well, was that he thought of himself as an “evangelist”  [in the article, Schlesinger says “revivalist”].68 A lot of the conflict between Kissinger and Schlesinger had to do with this very different view of what the long-term  strengths and weaknesses were between ourselves and the Soviets. Once again,  this was probably one of these areas where having some sense of economics and  so on, even if it’s the Agency’s, which was pushing out all this bum dope about  the Soviet economy, in the sense that [indistinct] the U.S. is not badly off, but a…  
- Q2: Were you involved in the move toward limited nuclear options at all at this  point?69  
- Marshall: Yeah, right, although Donald Cotter, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense  for Atomic Energy, was the main person involved in that.  
- Q2: But your strategic force assessment, I mean, did you have one out, or in some  form that Schlesinger looked at before they started doing that, or was that preceded…  
- Marshall: No, no, no. That came about because of Schlesinger’s own work when  he was at RAND. One of the major things he did before leaving…well, it started  back probably around ‘66, ‘67, ‘68.70 One of the things he spent most of his time  on was this issue of “the least miserable option,” which was the way it was talked  about. You know, if you really face up to the thing of what are you actually going  to do after deterrence has failed, then this notion of simply unleashing the Single  Integrated Operational Plan is—  
- Q2: —is silly.  
- Marshall: Absolutely, nonsense.  
- Q2: Cotter was at AE, or where was he?  
- Marshall: He was in AE. When Schlesinger was at the Atomic Energy Commission,  he picked up a bunch of people who became very close to him and he brought  along. One was Cotter. Cotter maybe had been down at Sandia National Laboratories, I forget exactly. Another was Hoffmann.  
- Q2: Fred?  
- Marshall: No, the fellow who became the Secretary of the Army later on.  
- Q2: Oh, Marty Hoffmann.  
- Marshall: Marty Hoffmann, who was a lawyer. He was the legal counsel, I think,  at Atomic Energy and Schlesinger brought him over and]made him the legal  counsel here. The secretary, Evelyn Irons, who he brought with… well, maybe she  showed up first. She maybe was with OMB and then went with him to…yes, she  was first with him in OMB. So there were a cluster of people that… 
- Q2: Were they your main allies in the Building [Eds: the Pentagon], or who were your  main kind of two or three, besides the Secretary, who were you kind of—Zumwalt  and you close at all?  
- Marshall: A little bit, and I was on that Chief of Naval Operations Executive Panel  that he had formed. I joined it in ‘72, when I was still at the NSC, and continued  while here. I would say that Cotter was a big ally. I liked him, although Lukasik was  very helpful. Cotter and Pete Haas, Deputy Director for Science and Technology of  the Defense Nuclear Agency…  See, the problem was that they wanted to do a whole bunch of things and I was  in a very good bureaucratic position to help them, because, after all, Net Assessment can do anything, right? I mean look at almost any issue. So they wanted  to do a lot of work on the Soviet doctrine, and exercises, and so on. It all started  with a DNA-DARPA effort that began in probably ‘73, ‘72, and was called the New  Alternatives thing. It was an effort to look at technologies and what could they do  for you, and it was there that there was this first, not really first, but a major push  toward precision-guidance weapons. By the time I moved here in ‘73, Cotter had,  of course, come before me, and he and the DNA people very much wanted to  look at how you would attack the Soviet forces. And there was this multiplicity of  interests. On the one hand, our position in tactical nuclears meant that they had  to remain dispersed until they tried to converge for attacks quickly, but then you  could try to attack them so that [indistinct] disorganized [indistinct], but in order  to do that you had to look a lot at how they would really come down, and find the  details of their operational arrangements.  That’s some of the things they wanted to do. It all verged on being intelligence and  this and that, and they would be precluded from doing it. But if I tasked them to do  it, then they could do that, or they could then get the intelligence people to go along  with whatever. So they came seeking me. Also, Haas came offering lots of money,  not only for the things that they wanted to do, but things I wanted to do. Additionally, I had no budget, so I got money for studies out of DNA and out of DARPA.  
- Q4: A thing about the bureaucratic aspects of this: somewhere in this same period  there is, what’s it called, Net Technical Assessment, NTA, run by Jim Wade at that  point? ‘75? ‘74?  
- Marshall: No, it was that retired Army general, John something.  
- Q4: There was a Navy Admiral also. Maybe it was a retired Navy admiral at the time.  
- Marshall: Yes, oh that’s right.  
- Q4: Yeah, it was a retired Navy admiral.  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q4: Then there’s another guy named Don Marshall—  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q4: —who was in, I never did figure out where his position was [Special Assistant  (Policy) to the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy], but he  had assessment or net assessment with Schlesinger.
- Marshall: Well, he had been out at DNA.  
- Q2: He was an Air Force colonel, I think.  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q4: This one was, he was an Army colonel, Don Marshall. And then there was the  famous Tony Cordesman grab for Net Assessment which occurs in this period.  
- Marshall: That comes later, during the Rumsfeld period.  
- Q4: Oh, right.  
- Marshall: Which we haven’t got to and before which we ought to break off.  
- Q4: You know, at some point in this story, I think you, hope [indistinct] would sort of  do a, what did we learn from the tapestry of these anecdotes about net assessment and how it goes [?], and how you establish it, and so on and so forth. My  footnote/comment at this point is that there is a story which has to do with how  difficult it is to do this kind of analysis, and therefore how hard it is to convince  others to engage in a particular [indistinct]. When we were trying to convince the  Army that they ought to be doing things, we took on, sort of… For example, there  was the tank crew training net assessment comparison…  
- Marshall: Yes, now that happened later… well, maybe not. I forget…  
- Q4: …well, the point was that there were people who were saying, “Why would we  want to compare ourselves to the way the Soviets train their tank crews, because  our training establishments don’t fight. Our tanks fight. So who the hell cares  if they train one way and we train another.” It’s obviously an extraordinarily, in  my view, just simpleminded point for them to take, but you would say it was an  example of how difficult it was to engage them.  There was another aspect of the net assessment one, sort of really subtext, was  just simply getting people to compare things.  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q4: Because of what you might learn by asking, “Why are they different?” People  were very reluctant to do that.  
- Marshall: Remember the other thing that Pickett was involved in we had this captured equipment.  Q2: Oh, from the ‘73 war.  
- Marshall: Yeah, right. And there were all kinds of stories about this stuff and how  terrible it was, and how difficult it was, and so on. So…  
- Q4: In particular, one was this business about Russian tanks are so much better than  American tanks. No, American tanks are so much better than Russian tanks.  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q4: So you basically forced a runoff between an [Eds: American] M-60 and a [Eds:  Soviet] T-62 out at Aberdeen.  
- Marshall: Right. 
- Q4: And took an American crew and drove one, and took an American crew and  drove the other and put them over various obstacle courses. And then they got  back these observations like, “Well, yeah, you’re right, the M-60 has an automatic  transmission and the Russian one does not, and the M-60 has a steering wheel  and the Russian has a sort of lever.” But the driver said, “I mean it’s no big deal. It  doesn’t require that much more force to shift gears,” and so on and so forth. Then  there was another one about, well, the crew compartment [Eds: in the T-62] is  much too tight, and the comment from the loader or the tank commander was,  “This is the only tank that I’ve ever been in where you can probably sleep while  you are driving, while it was being driven across… because you are wedged in  tight enough that you don’t bang your head against every piece of the…” I mean  it was just one thing after another one.  
- Marshall: Right, yeah, right. And Pickett went around and interviewed the people  who were putting these things back in working order and had driven them a lot  just to see… See, a lot of the claims were that these are so uncomfortable, so  bad, that people, once they’re in them for a while, just can’t function. And one of  the tests for the tank involved the fact that the scoring system was related to the  accuracy and pointing and firing the gun; the notion was that they would get so  tired that the scores would go way down. It didn’t turn out to be true. And there  were wild stories about, you know, people can’t do it, their backs go out, this or  that. Then there was the ZSU…  
- Q4: 23-4?  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q4: Another sort of piece, there were a lot of stories, but one of the pieces that has  to do with how the intelligence community does the analysis of these kinds of  systems… For example, if you handed them a T-62 or you handed them a ZSU-  23-4 and asked them for an appraisal of sort of the crew comfort and operational  effectiveness, for example, what they gave you back were these very precise  psychometric measures on vehicle, sort of, this will take a person who has a sitting  height of 34.675 inches, to three-digit accuracies, which is the 60th percentile of  the average height of the European male, and it has a leg room of 32.7215 inches,  which will accommodate da-da, da-da. And after you got through reading this  tremendous amount of data…  
- Q2: “What does that mean?”  
- Q4: And they were proud about the output, the people who produced this, and it  was just absolutely just narrow, but they were very enthused about the output.  But it had no relevance and it wasn’t like it had relevance to anybody, you could  determine. It was a repeat of what we had seen elsewhere, and people were producing things because that’s what they had produced before, and the mere fact  of the production was a reward in its own right. The fact that it wasn’t very useful  was irrelevant.  
- Marshall: I forget about timing of the tank crew thing, but it ended up in the hands  of [Gen.] Paul Gorman, who was then at the Army Training and Doctrine Command. Best single study every done by any Service for me.
- Q4: Gorman has this meeting with Andy. Door closes. And he looks at Andy, and he  says, “Mr. Marshall, off the record, we have a national disaster here.” That was his  lead in, and it got better thereafter.  
- Marshall: Right.  
- Q4: Probably can’t write that up.  
- Marshall: Right, right. “Give us time to fix it. Do you mind if the study is delayed?”  [Indistinct] later fix this.  
- Q2: He was the National Intelligence Officer for General Purpose Forces…  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q2: …in CIA when he was a two-star, so that must have been earlier…  
- Q4: He was a brigadier at this point.  
- Marshall: A one-star.  
- Q2: A one-star, so were you over here when he was at CIA?  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q2: And did you have any interactions with him?  
- Marshall: Yes I did.  
- Q2: He wrote, when he was the NIO, originally a classified Studies in Intelligence  thing, which I think is still classified, on how you do net assessments. 71 A very  good piece. Anything specific come to mind of your interaction with him when he  was over there at CIA? Any projects you had undertaken with him?  
- Marshall: We didn’t interact a lot. There were certain earlier relations, which were  always very friendly. And there wasn’t too much to interact about.  
- Q2: So you didn’t provide specific support on the ground forces assessment or  anything like that?  
- Marshall: No.  
- Q4: When does Project 186 and Phil Karber begin to appear on the horizon? After  the Schlesinger period?  
- Marshall: No, it had started before. It had started before I even got here. Karber was  put under contract by Pat Parker, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Assessment, to start the thing.Then I just took it over when it… Right.  
- Q2: And you started Project Eager, when?  
- Marshall: Project Eager, Project Eager is…  
- Q2: …is, was about ‘73, wasn’t it?  
- Q4: What’s Eager?  
- Q2: That’s the thing that led into the SAIC Foreign Systems Research Center, wasn’t it?  
- Marshall: Yeah. It’s this effort to read all of the Soviet ops research military literature,  and try to understand, to the extent that they are into analytical analyses, modeling and so on, how do they do that? And what does that tell you about how they  think about, measure things?  
- Q2: So was that about this time or a little later?  
- Marshall: I think that was probably around ‘74, ‘75.  
- Q2: So Schlesinger was…  
- Marshall: I think that Schlesinger actually started down this road when he was at  the CIA, and started it. It was originally a CIA project, and then I became joint with  them, and finally, they dropped out and I was the supporter.  
- Q4: You know, Andy, one of the characteristics of this period [indistinct] I’m not  sure on what the grounds [indistinct] it seems to be this constant pressure from  you over literally years to force the agencies to stick the CIA to think about the  Russians or about other opponents…  
- Marshall: Yes…  
- Q4: …with less attachment to the analytical constructs that they sort of were taught  at college and applied to day-to-day living, and so on and so forth. I’d like to be  able to say that that’s probably the first time that the Agency’s been put under  constant pressure, and begin to get away from old-timer’s analysis, but I find it  hard to believe that they could be that insulated, and could be that insulated  from pressures like that in the ‘50s and ‘60s.  
- Marshall: Well, I think in the ‘50s they were quite open. The reason I got to know  a lot of the Agency guys was because they would come out to RAND. And they  were interested in how we got this, or what analysis we used? It’s true that once I  got into government, and had customers who were the people that I was serving  and I thought needed better analysis, then I was pressuring them and tasking  them in various ways to try to do these things.  But to tell one last story: One of the things that I did for Schlesinger, that I think  I mentioned, was this business of being an intermediary to the intelligence  community. I mentioned my work with regard to the Soviet military burden and  the cost of their military programs, but another case was this thing that flared up  about Somalia. The Russians appeared to be taking over the use of this airfield  and they had some ships tied up in the nearby port. The airfield was very close  to the seashore, and they probably had missiles in there; they were constructing  some buildings that looked like they might house the missiles.72 So Schlesinger  wanted an analysis by the people at the Agency about, “What do we know about  the whole process by which the Russians go about acquiring access and the use  of facilities? Are there some general patterns? Where are they in this thing?” and  so on. So I went out there, and I think it may have even been Fritz Ermarth who  was in charge of the group I contacted.  They started asking what I thought were kind of dumb questions, like, “We could  do a better job if you could tell us what decision this is going to lead to,” and so  on. I said, “First, I’m here to tell you Schlesinger wants it. Why don’t you just do it.  Secondly, listening to you I come to the conclusion that you don’t know anything about this government. There isn’t any decision that’s going to be made next Thursday or something like that. There’s this controversy about what the  significance of this is. Don’t you know that on issues like this there’s some kind of  complex social-cultural-political process that takes place, and these assessments  are part of an input to that process, and hopefully they make people reach conclusions that are wiser than if they don’t have this input? In any case, Schlesinger  already knows what he believes; you’re not instructing him about what he believes. He wants you to produce something that’s useful in this type of long-term  effort to persuade others that maybe this could be something serious that they  should pay attention to.”  
- Q2: This goes back to the cooking-the-books argument. I mean, it’s those people,  “Tell me why you want to use the thing, ostensibly so I can shape my analytic  effort, but really so that I can figure out what answer you are looking for so I can  cook the books and give you the answer.”  
- Marshall: Yeah. We better stop. When we take up Rumsfeld and Brown and some  other…Look, thank you for coming.

### 1973–1976

- Marshall: Let’s start now. What the intention is, is to finish off the ‘70s. I read the record of the last session. We bogged down as we were just approaching the tenure  of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. But I also looked at it from the point of  view that there are a lot of stories that are not as well organized as one might like  about general themes. So what I thought I’d do this time is say a little bit more  about the Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger period and also try to focus  some on some major themes, then deal with Rumsfeld and Secretary of Defense  Harold Brown.  Let me start by talking a little bit about the period as a whole, the ‘70s. It seems to  me that a lot of things happened in the ‘70s. I’m not talking about events in the  world, I’m talking about me and about the shape of this office which, in effect,  was just set during that time period. At least net assessment as it currently exists  was created intellectually in that period, to a large extent. So if you’re looking at  the book, the ‘70s really looks like a period that, when you get it all fleshed out,  might end up being a couple of chapters or something like that, or more than just  one chapter. I think it’s hard to do it justice, and I haven’t done enough digging  back and so on to fully reconstruct the period.  The other thing about the ‘70s, as I thought about that period, and also the period  really of ‘69, because I actually thought of this as starting in the summer or fall  of ‘69… In thinking about it, what struck me about myself and what happened  is how important assuming new responsibilities was in getting one to rethink  how you really ought to think about some particular area. It certainly happened  at RAND when I took over from Schlesinger to run the strategic forces program,  because it made me focus on the question, “What in the hell should RAND really  be doing? What should the program really look like? How should we be thinking about strategic forces?” And that led to this whole thing on the long-term  competition and a kind of change in paradigm of, OK, the way you really want to  look at this thing is very differently than we have been. In part, it’s a recapturing  of some style of thinking that existed at RAND at the very beginning but that had  disappeared. And partly it reflected the influence of the business policy/strategy  framework that had come up in my look at organizations and so on. Just the fact  that I had this new responsibility required me to look at that.  A similar thing, I think, really happened with the whole net assessment business. In  some ways, it was fortunate that during the early ‘70s, when I first went to the  National Security Council staff, the main thing that—while nominally this was called  the Net Assessment Group, and we were to start that activity or recreate something  at the NSC level—the main tasks that we really spent most of our time on, particularly Chip Pickett and I, were on the implementation of the Nixon reorganization  of the intelligence community and all that, which, in retrospect, wasn’t intellectually  very interesting. I learned something about how stubborn, stupid, organizations  can be, the response of the Central Intelligence Agency to all this and their total  failure to really fix anything, do anything. But that’s an observation about the world  in a certain sense. It didn’t change the way I thought about things very much. But there was this opportunity to really think a little bit at the NSC about, “Alright,  we’re supposed to do these net assessments: How should you really do these? If  these things are to be serious and people are to base some decisions on them,  how do you really do the best possible job?” So I had time, then. I think that it  could have been that, given some responsibility and somebody say the first one  has to be produced in six months, you would pull out…systems analysis and …  these models and say “Let’s do something.” And that’s kind of intellectually respectable or acceptable to people, but may be very far from, if you’re truly serious,  what the thing ought to be like. So I think it was actually very fortunate that we  didn’t have to jump into it right away, which, as I mentioned the last time, came  about because Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird threw up all kinds of bureaucratic obstacles. So I had time to conduct a leisurely review of the state of modeling,  which I hadn’t had much hope for anyway, but found to be dismal in offering a  real basis for anything that anybody ought to trust.74  Q2: It’s gotten so much better since then, hasn’t it?  
- Marshall: No, not really. And then I also had time to think about what the whole  strategy for doing these things might be.  I remember also how struck I was about how people thought this was very  important. And people would come around and see me. I remember, in particular,  General James Polk coming to see me. And again, right at the beginning I certainly was very interested in this notion of weaknesses as well as strengths on both  sides, and he had a lot of interesting stories about how he had operated when he  was the commander in Germany [Commander in Chief of the U.S. Army in Europe  and Commander of the NATO Central Army Group], and had initially asked his intelligence officers to tell him about what the other people really were like and got  absolutely nothing out of it, and so he chose what was a very effective strategy  for him {…}. He sat down with the junior analysts and they told him stories about  {…} and the screwups and so on. Out of that they got educated about the kind of  things he was really interested in to base judgments on: How ready? How trained?  What were the real capabilities of these other guys? And then they used to collect  materials for him. He would come back every three months and sit down with  them and hear about all this stuff.  
- Q3: Was this the time of the very focused look at one {…}?  Marshall: No, these were just general stories. Later we organized something like  that, again during the ‘70s, as an adjunct to the [Gen. Paul] Gorman study of tank  crew training {…} to look at things like that. At any rate, I just thought it’s, in reflection, interesting that responsibility does make one more responsible and serious.  
- Q3: Sometimes.  
- Marshall: Sometimes.  
- Q3: For some people.  
- Marshall: For some people.  
- Q2: Would you also say that that period on the NSC shaped how you, how you went  about conducting the business of this office over the subsequent decades… 
- Marshall: No. I don’t think so. I thought a lot about how might you go about it, I  mean intellectually. But as far as the office was concerned, that was created after  we got here.  
- Q2: I mean how you went about doing the business of the office. One of the things  that always struck me about this office was there was never any suspense date for  any product. The office sort of worked the product until it was good. It wasn’t like  the office had to produce one by September or January. The office weren’t driven  by the other internals within the Department…  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.  
- Q2: …like, got to get an annual report out or things like that. When Jeff McKitrick  replaced Barry Watts, you said, “Take six months to read everything you can in the  office and then we’ll start talking about…” Assignments where they said take six  months and get smart as you can about these things were rare. Does that go back  to your RAND days, or your own personal thing, or do you think it was shaped in  some way by the NSC?  
- Marshall: No, mostly my own personal view of things. Also, we’ve had the luxury  and been extraordinarily fortunate in just being allowed to do what I wanted  to do, in a sense. Of course, there were times when people asked for something  and then we did it more or less on a schedule. But my feeling was that, in the first  place, you didn’t have to update these balance assessments more than every  couple of years. Things didn’t happen, turn over, unless there was some major  new source of information.  
- Q2: Or the collapse of the Soviet Union or something like that.  
- Marshall: The other thing was that you really wanted to produce a high-quality  product, and so you took the time to do that.  
- Q3: Just following up on this business of how responsibility changes the way you  think: Was it because you were given responsibility for certain intellectual tasks  that you found yourself thinking about how to do that, or was it the fact that you  were given responsibility for managing the activities of subordinates so you had  to think about how you would break it up into tasks which people had to work  on, or both?  
- Marshall: No, I think it was mainly the first.  
- Q3: So somebody gives you a subject and said understand…  
- Marshall: Well, in the one case, the RAND thing, I was to take over this program and  looked at what people were doing. And I didn’t think that amounted to anything.  Then the question was, "What should we be doing?" I wanted to determine what  a really adequate look at this would be. Then I came to this view that the way you  needed to look at it was in terms of a long-term competition. Therefore, these  studies of individual choices of, you know, this new bomber, really needed to be  seen as moves in this competition, as part of the implementation of a strategy  for achieving some set of goals that you really had, and that it just shouldn’t be a  matter of a more modern and up to-date way of killing the same targets that you  had been “killing” for some while, or just a response to some change in the Soviet air defense system. My view was that you really need to think of this thing in a  very different way, and therefore look at the decision about a bomber in terms of  the whole force and the whole strategy that you were pursuing.  Of course, the fact was that, at a certain level, the U.S. never has strategies like  that. Organizations can—The Air Force, say, was committed to the bombers and  had some sense of the strategy, although it was never articulated very well. But  my experience was that once you had articulated it that way, there were often  people—here in the Pentagon it was particularly the guys in the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering who came from the business world—  who immediately grabbed onto that. Somebody like Dick DeLauer [Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering]. You talked to him about how part  of the thing that we’re doing is driving up the cost of their staying in business, and  he quickly had some of his guys do a rough calculation of the cost of the Soviet  air defense system and what you might do, what’s the next set of costs you can  impose on them. In that sense, some of the civilians, particularly these guys from  the business world, had far more the right framework for looking at this.  I think it really happened in the ‘80s, but I’ll tell the story of General Lew Allen’s  [Air Force Chief of Staff, 1978–1982] reaction to the kind of competitive strategies  sorts of things. He wasn’t sure it was wise for two reasons. One was that we were  too erratic, and therefore we might start something, they would react, and then  we wouldn’t continue on to the next stage, and we’d be worse off than if we’d  not done anything, which is quite plausible. On the other hand, his view was that  the costs are meaningless to them. It’s as though they had infinite resources and  there was no sense that they…It was as though…  
- Q3: There weren’t opportunity costs.  
- Marshall: Yeah. His view suggested that in socialist countries there are no opportunity costs. They can always just go ahead and put more resources in, and there’s  no pain and nothing ever happened. Whereas other people have a sense of, “No,  they have limited resources, too, and there are consequences,” and so on.  OK. So let me then talk about the ‘70s and what are some of the interesting  themes to me, from the intellectual side of things, apart from this whole invention  of net assessment.  The thing that strikes me the most is the constant interest in, going back to this  business of perceptions, concern for the calculations and perspectives of the  other players. As I mentioned last time, that came out of interest that Schlesinger  and I had at RAND, triggered by reading, at least initially, and I think for both of us,  Robert Ardrey’s The Territorial Imperative, and interest in, essentially, the peacetime aspects or uses of military power. 75 One of the things that struck me and  struck him was that almost all the analysis about military forces goes into the war  and how the fighting might be done. While people use words like “presence” and  have some general sense that, yes, it’s better to be strong than to be weak and  things like that, there’s very little analysis of this matter. In particular, Schlesinger  was very interested in the question of, “alright, these things are going on, How do  you do well at it? What actions, what ways of demonstration really are effective?” And then it spills over into the whole area of deception and many other things,  like Henry Kissinger’s and Richard Nixon’s views on crises as opportunities as well  as problems.  Even before I got to the Pentagon, when I was working for Kissinger I tried to get  the intelligence people to do some analyses, as best they could, of the Russians  and what they pay attention to about us. What things get us good scores in their  books as against things that get us bad or indifferent scores? And you know, you  come up with some interesting things. Then later, there are still other developments, and you even get into issues of the prestige effects of reaching the moon  and all of that.76  But clearly this theme of perceptions and the peacetime uses of military power is  something that runs through a lot of what was done in the ‘70s.  The second thing is this long-term competition perspective, and in the beginning  and in the middle ‘70s, in particular, this writing of various things on actual strategy or strategic planning sorts of things for Rumsfeld and for Brown, which, again,  brought back in a lot of these economic dimensions of things, and led to the  creation of the Investment Balance and some of these things. Those two things,  plus all the things that get into the development of net assessment, are the main  intellectual things, I think.  Let me just talk briefly about the Schlesinger period, to pick up some things that  I think didn’t come through clear enough during the last talk. This was a period,  really, of the development of the state of the art of doing these things. We had the  time to do them. Soon after I got here, Schlesinger and I talked, and there were  these three areas that I mentioned last time. He was interested in assessments on  the strategic balance, the NATO-Warsaw Pact balance, and the maritime balance.  We started to work on that, and made, I think, the least progress on the strategic  balance. I also did a bunch of special things for Schlesinger.  It also was after I got here that we changed the nature of the task, in some sense,  for net assessment. That is, up till that time we were tasking the people in the  Pentagon to do assessments from the NSC, because that’s the way it was thought  that it would be done. They were broad, general studies with many participants  and task forces, which ended up—I came here before the first one was finished—  with these brokered, bullshit analyses; you know, “the Soviets don’t have any  weaknesses” nonsense out of the Defense Intelligence Agency and so on. After  we had finished off that first one, Schlesinger’s attitude was, to put it in his way  of speaking, “Enough of this shit. Let’s get on and do something serious.” So the  whole thing then became that these were private assessments sent to him, and  he read them, and he would then pass them on if he wanted to. The fact was that  we were still learning how to do it, so we didn’t have a lot of really great things to  offer him, because of start-up times and the fact that once you started, you found  that none of the right data existed, and all that. So we weren’t so helpful.  Another thing I spent a lot of time on was serving as an intermediary for him with  the intelligence community, trying to get special studies, special assessments  done, trying to get them to look again and see whether they wouldn’t find some different answers to things like the military burden of the Soviet Union and some  things of that sort.77  But basically, the whole way of doing things began to take shape then. Certainly the avoidance of models, the reliance on judgment, the importance of data  on long-term trends and asymmetries, the importance of really understanding  the other side’s doctrine and concepts, which would be a major aspect of the  asymmetries, were all part of the net assessment approach. As I mentioned, there  was a lot of attention to the psychological-political effects or uses of military  forces. And it wasn’t just the military forces. For example, when Schlesinger was  Secretary, it became the U.S.’s turn to host one of these big, formal NATO meetings [Nuclear Planning Group meeting, 17 Jun 1975].78 In discussion with him,  we decided that… Again, one of the things your forces do is not just impress the  enemy, but your allies. Well, it’s not even just your forces. So we consciously chose  to hold the meeting in California, so that the defense ministers and other allied  officials could fly across the whole country, because most of these people never  get beyond Washington. And so it’s held at the Naval Postgraduate School, which  I knew had appropriate facilities. And then they were taken down one day to the  missile-launching sites and tours of the silos at Vandenberg Air Force Base and  things of that sort. All, in part, based on bucking up the allies. So Schlesinger was  very interested in all of these dimensions, as I was.  
- Q3: Did you get any feedback?  
- Marshall: No, it’s hard to know. I don’t know, it didn’t, I think…I even found a Robinson Jeffers poem for Schlesinger to use in his speech at this meeting. At any rate,  he was very, very interested in all that.  Another thing that we did along this line, I mean while we were thinking a lot  about the Soviets, how they score us, how they see us—again to follow up on  the business of the allies—I undertook, with Nathan Leites’s help, to try to find  out, If we’re going to try to impress the allies as well as the Russians, what do they  notice? What do they pay attention to? I used my connections into the French to  talk with them and found some interesting things, which wasthat what appeared  to weigh very highly with them, because of the importance of their own nuclear submarines to them, was essentially antisubmarine warfare, in the sense of  who was ahead in that. That seemed to get very big weight. Nathan went off to  interview the British, and the Germans, in particular.79 Then subsequently, he  did another thing on Germany, which we had to circumscribe all publication of,  because, in essence, it said it is very doubtful that the Germans will actually fight.  But Nathan had some very keen insights into the Germans.80  
- Q3: Is this the time when he came up with this image of “pygmies, midgets, and  giants?”  
- Marshall: No, that was just verbally. That antedates this, I think. It goes back to…  Right. The other thing that had a big impact as far as the office was concerned, I  think, was that we got a reasonable start on getting funding for studies through  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and through the Defense Nuclear  Agency. Again, one of the things that happened during this time was that Don Cotter was here and wanted to do various kind of studies, and Pete Haas [Deputy  Director for Science and Technology] of DNA came around and asked what they  could do for me. That was, in part, what he would have done anyway, but it also,  I’m sure, was seen as something they could use to then get me to authorize or  request DNA to do things that it wanted to for Cotter, but that Cotter didn’t necessarily have the authority or the right portfolio to get into. For example, Cotter was  very interested in this whole business of analyzing Soviet exercises in Europe, and  in the conventional aspects of that as well as the nuclear, but given his portfolio, it  was hard for him to get into that and hard for DNA to get into it.  
- Q2: Where was he?  
- Marshall: He was the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy.  
- Q2: AE?  
- Marshall: AE, yeah. But Net Assessment had the virtue that we could use them for  anything. We could say, “We want you to do those things.” So a lot of that was done.  But pretty much from the beginning, we got a fair amount of money, and that got us  into this pattern of extensive contracting for outside work, which was very important,  particularly in some of these cases where you didn’t believe the CIA answers to a lot of  questions. You’d go get somebody intelligent to look at those questions.  OK. Let’s go on to Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld came in around late November or early December of ‘75 [20 Nov 1975]. He was here during ‘76, so he was here just for essentially a  little over one year. I was very impressed with Rumsfeld. I think, in fact, in some ways,  of all the people I’ve worked for, that he was potentially the best Secretary of Defense.  
- Q2: That’s a lot of people. I mean, that’s pretty…  
- Marshall: I think that because of his political skills and ability and interest in using  good people. Schlesinger, of course, was a close friend of mine, but he scared too  many people. People were frightened of him. I told the story last time that when  he was the Director of Central Intelligence, a large part of the middle management hid from him out at CIA. He and I always got along terrifically, but lots of  people were just frightened of him.  
- Q3: He was on a visiting committee for a Harvard thing and he had the same effect  at Harvard. People were terrorized—“Oh no! We’re going to have to give…  Schlesinger is going to be there and he is going say some goddam thing and  we’re not going to know what to say.”  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q2: Of course that’s true.  
- Q3: Yes. I got along fine with him.  
- Marshall: He and I got to be very close at RAND. And there was a set of people that  he dealt with, Cotter and others. But kind of the ordinary bureaucrat was just  terrified.  
- Q2: So you think that it was Rumsfeld’s bureaucratic and organizational, people  skills… 
- Marshall: Yeah, that’s right. He seemed also, as I say, to use people extraordinarily  well, all kinds of people. And then he also was politically astute, you know. But he  didn’t have a long stay.  He largely left us alone, except that he would make requests, I mean when there  was some question or some issue that he was interested in or concerned with.  He had some questions, I remember, about the strategic balance and what did I  think, or the nature of deterrence, or something like that, and I would write him a  paper. We also created some short, four- or five-page assessments, kind of summary stuff. But basically we were left alone and we went ahead and did that.  The other thing that impressed me about him was that he had this kind of strategic sense of, “Let’s think about where we’re going.” And he tried to do something  for the Navy, on the naval programs. I remember he asked for a paper overnight.  Jim Roche and I prepared something that he liked a lot. I can remember the  meeting that took place. It was on a Saturday morning. Rumsfeld had a bunch of  people in. And an Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation guy got up to talk  about things and was going on and obviously had no sense at all about what kind  of perspective Rumsfeld was interested in.  So about half way through the thing, Rumsfeld says, “Why don’t we stop looking  at our shoelaces and raise our sights and see where we are going.”  
- Q3: This is an example of not scaring people…  
- Marshall: And it was because of that, that and our own interests, that Roche and  I wrote this July ‘76 thing, saying, “What would a strategy for defense really look  like? How would you organize it, using business analogies of, What ‘businesses’  are you in? What are you trying to do in that ‘business?’ What are the major trends  and other things that you ought to take account of in thinking about that part of  the ‘business?’” That’s how we got into doing something beyond the more narrow  assessment. That carried over later, which we will get to, to Brown, who was also  interested in this kind of thing. In fact, while we wrote this thing for Rumsfeld,  that is the July ‘76 thing, and he looked at it and responded favorably, Jimmy  Carter came in as President and there wasn’t much time to do anything about it.  Then we sent it to Harold Brown, and he liked it, and then we did some strategic  planning experiments for him.81 And we’ll get to that later.  The other interesting thing that happened during the Rumsfeld period was the  start of this strategic dialogue with the Israelis, which ran from April of ‘76 through  about 1980.82 The Israelis had approached Schlesinger twice. He may have been  approached through other things, but I knew of two approaches because they  came through me.  Something else which is worth mentioning about the Schlesinger period was that  shortly after I got here—I came here right after the Israeli-Arab War, Yom Kippur  War—Schlesinger put me in charge of a quickie “lessons learned” effort. Each of  the Services was going to undertake a much longer term, thorough effort, and  the Joint Staff ran off and did something, but he wanted an effort to try to get  any lessons learned that could be useful in any way. So we organized an effort,  and I borrowed Tony Cordesman from ARPA to go over there and gather materials and so on. And we had tried to send S.L.A. Marshall there. He made a quickie trip  and talked to the Israeli military that he knew best, came back, wrote something.  Schlesinger liked him a lot and wanted to send him back in, but then the Israelis  wouldn’t let him back in the country.  
- Q2: Jeez. Why?  
- Marshall: The basic reason was, I think, that… Look, from the Israeli point of view,  that war was very traumatic, because it showed up deficiencies in their planning,  in their thinking. So there was a big internal quarrel in Israel afterwards. There was  this big investigation. I forget the name of that commission that they set up.  
- Q3: Agranat?  
- Marshall: Yeah. So it was very controversial, and Marshall probably was most associated with one of the factions, and so they didn’t want him back in the country.  So we couldn’t get him to do it, so we organized this other effort and, as I say, put  Cordesman on it.  When Cordesman came back, he relayed this request by the Israelis that they  wanted to set up a direct channel between the Ministry of Defense and the Defense Department. We found out later, I think, that part of it was related to the fact  that they did not trust their ambassador here [Simcha Dinitz], who they felt was  interfering with the appropriate discussions between the two military establishments. Schlesinger checked with Kissinger, who was at State, and the thing was  kind of vetoed. I don’t think Schlesinger was strongly tempted anyway, and it was  a little unspecific as to what they wanted. There was a similar kind of request that  happened later.  But after Schlesinger had left and Rumsfeld was already on board, a man named  Saadia Amiel came to see me, and he saw other people, again requesting the  establishment of this kind of dialogue. In the aftermath of the ‘73 war, the Israelis  were trying to create more of an Office of the Secretary of Defense-like structure  to both oversee the forces, but also they became aware—well, it goes back to the  ‘67 war, when the French had cut them off after having been their main supplier—that they were beginning to do more of their own weaponry, and, I guess,  after the ‘73 war, they decided they needed to do more thinking, planning in  order to decide what they ought to invest in.  So Amiel came by, and again I kind of put him off, but he finally convinced Deputy  Secretary of Defense Robert Ellsworth that some such interchange should take  place. Rumsfeld agreed, and I was asked to be the point of contact for doing this.  They wanted to keep these discussions out of any forum which the Israelis could  use to argue for, you know, “What about the $200 million we asked for?” “Where’s  the shipment of so and so?” So it was explicitly understood that this was not to  be a forum for any of that. It was to be a discussion with them, and also in some  ways a channel for advice to them, as to how they ought to think about their own  future, and do a better job of planning and so on. Also, the thing was to be kept  very quiet. And in fact, no one knew about this, which was a problem, because  the people who nominally do all the relations with the Israelis, got their nose got  out of joint and so on. But initially, we had a kind of cover for doing it, which was, “We’re going there just to get information.”  
- Q2: So State Department did not approve that?  
- Marshall: I don’t know whether that was ever checked with State. I have no idea.  But when Brown came in, he was told about this. The thing was done on a basis  of twice a year, and by that time, they came here in April of ‘76 and we went there  in September, October, something like that, of ‘76. In the Carter Administration,  Brown then asked about it, and he, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, and Assistant  to the President for National Security Affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski knew about it  and were the only… And we would send him reports of the discussions. And, I  don’t know, I presume he told them, at some breakfast meetings or something  like that, about things.  
- Q2: Who within the Defense Department knew?  
- Marshall: Well, people then sort of knew it was happening, but they got none of  the reports.  
- Q2: They didn’t know what it was?  
- Marshall: They sort of knew what it was, but they didn’t… It ended in the last year  of the Carter Administration because Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs David McGiffert and company couldn’t stand it any longer,  that is, to be excluded.  
- Q2: How’s the intelligence community play on that?  
- Marshall: Not at all.  
- Q2: None of them involved, they got none of the reports, they never saw you over  there talking to the Israelis and wondered, “What the hell?”  
- Marshall: Well, the attachés knew we were over there, and they would hear something about it. What they reported, I don’t know. We didn’t pay much attention to  that. The ambassador there we would talk to; during part of the time it was Sam  Lewis. My counterpart, initially—I forget the man’s name, a guy who was a special  assistant to Shimon Peres, who was the defense minister when the thing started,  and had been the ambassador to France, and then later when the Likud came in,  was the Deputy Minister of Defense, and his name was Mordechai…Zippori.  So at any rate, there isn’t too much to say, as I say, about the Rumsfeld period, I  think, as far as interests that continued to develop. 


### 1969–1973 

- Q1: Did you begin working for Henry Kissinger because he and President Nixon  were dissatisfied with the National Intelligence Estimates they were receiving?  
- Marshall: [Name of person unclear] and Mitchell conveyed the same comments  about the NIEs. It happened before I got involved. What I was told by Kissinger  was that shortly after the Administration was in place, Nixon had read a few NIEs.  He thought they were poor. He thought they were much worse than the ones he  remembered from when he had been the vice president—I don’t know whether  that’s really true. At any rate, he was greatly dissatisfied. So, he got Mitchell and  Kissinger to kind of look at things. And I think the three of them had a meeting to  compare notes on, “OK, what’s wrong with these things. Why don’t we like them?”  And that was one of the outstanding complaints—this lack of the separation of  the fact and opinion.84 Not just that they don’t separate them, but the thing is  written in a way that you don’t know whether that’s a fact, or a judgment, and  that you needed clearly stated what things are facts, and what things are inferences, judgments, and so on.  Now Kissinger, when he first talked to me, had other complaints, in the sense  that… He said to me, “Look, on the intelligence reports with respect to technology and so on, I’m not able to judge…but in the political stuff I feel I can judge and  they’re terrible. They’re not better than, and indeed they’re probably worse than  the kind of stuff you just read in the newspapers every day. They have no real  depth…. There’s nothing behind them. The people writing them don’t seem to  have any real understanding of what’s going on. They report what’s going on but  then they go off and they have their speculations and so on and they’re just not  really worth anything.”  
- Q1: Was Kissinger really interested in intelligence reform?  
- Marshall: Now, of course, part of the problem was Henry was… He would talk  with somebody like me or someone on the staff about how terrible, rotten it all  was, but then he would never really say that to the intelligence people. I think  it showed up in the whole way in which he conducted business while he was in  government, certainly in the State Department, where he gathered a set of people around him and then shut off the rest of the State Department.  I don’t know whether Nixon said he wanted someone to look into this, and that’s  why Henry called up and had me do these initial studies…  
- Q1: Did Fred Iklé recommended you to Kissinger for the work on intelligence?  
- Marshall: Well, I think so, I mean you might talk with Fred, I never really asked him.  
- Q1: When were you first asked to work for Kissinger?  
- Marshall: I must have got this call in September of ‘69 because I dropped by to see  Kissinger. Actually, the call came from Al Haig, asking me whether I’d come by  and see Kissinger. I was on my way to Europe for a lengthy vacation, probably  around the middle or the third week in September. So I dropped by Washington on my way and had a meeting with Kissinger. And then, I think I was away about a  month, and came back. Then had to disengage myself from the stuff I was doing  at RAND. I ended up going there in the very early part of December.  
- Q1: What can you say about your study of intelligence flow to the White House?  
- Marshall: The first thing that I did was this study tracing the whole flow of intelligence into the White House. How it happened, how decisions were made about  what to send. First I found out, “Where does this stuff actually come from?” Then  I interviewed people from each of these places to look into how it was they went  about deciding.  NSA had a very organized kind of interface and they had some people who would  come down essentially once a month and sit down… Not just with the guy who  ran the Situation Room, who was in fact a guy from NSA, but to sit around with  some other people and try to say, “Well, OK, what are the things that are of most  interest…”  
- Q1: But the NSA representatives would meet with people from the NSC staff? Who  was talking to whom?  
- Marshall: Well, it really was with the people in… My impression was they met with  the two people who ran the Situation Room and some of the other analysts who  were in the Situation Room. And it was probably through them that they understood what people on the staff wanted, were requesting, had an interest in, etc.,  etc. Whereas the CIA did none of that.  No, somebody told me that that the CIA took its cues from The New York Times  in deciding what intelligence to send to the White House; I don’t know whether  he was being dismissive. But their [Eds: the CIA’s] whole idea was that they know  what’s interesting and important, I mean you just have to read the newspapers or  something like that. It was, “We have this high-quality product…”  Now, a lot of that was particularly targeted on the issue of what went into the  daily President’s report, but just more generally, they just felt that through the  attendance of Helms and others at various meetings and other things that they  just didn’t need any special apparatus or to spend much real effort at finding out.  They just didn’t spend much effort of any systematic sort.  
- Q1: It was a long-standing problem?  
- Marshall: I think so. I talked with members of the Kennedy/Johnson NSC staffs and  they had similar complaints about intelligence. But again, one of the things I said  is how little they seemed to care about the customers, even though they protest  that, “We’re here to serve,” particularly these top level people would say this. One  of the first things I did when I went to work for Kissinger permanently was to go  through a number of books that Kissinger recently had written and extracted  from them sections that I thought provided the most insight into how he looked  at the world, what he thought, the kind of information that would be useful to  him, and sent that around to them. But that’s the kind of thing, in my view, if they  were serious about their offers of help, they would do for themselves. But they  didn’t do any of that. Just really crazy. So, to a large extent they thought that they had their way of doing things and  it was the best way and they didn’t—despite their talk of wanting to help, they  were very unresponsive to what customers actually wanted, even somebody like  Kissinger.  
- Q1: Did the CIA interface with groups at Harvard, Stanford, and elsewhere?  
- Marshall: The thing that struck me at the time was how at that point the CIA had  kind of shut itself off from much connection with any other organizations doing  stuff that could potentially have been interesting to it. And they kind of seemed  to have, for the while, just adopted the notion of, “We’re the real experts, we don’t  need to talk to other people.” Which was very different than the situation in the  ‘50s.  
- Q1: How did the CIA of the ‘50s differ from that of the late ‘60s?  
- Marshall: Well, I guess my own experience of it was really being at RAND… It may  have been particular to RAND, but not exclusively. Because they had this special  group up at MIT. I forget the guy’s name now who was up there… But they had a  number of connections out. Now, that was a kind of contracting arrangement to  get certain kinds of studies… But it was a way of having an interface with people  in academia, working in the economics and political science worlds. In the case  of RAND, people came out, particularly Frank Walters and Wally Seidel, who were  analysts working on the Soviet missile programs, aircraft programs. And in the  middle ‘50s, ‘56 or so, they started to come out to try to understand what RAND  was doing in the systems analysis-type of analysis techniques, how they might be  used in what they were doing. Also in a certain sense the beginnings of their effort to cost the Soviet programs, to do a comprehensive effort, that a guy named  Jerry Godaire, who was out at the Agency.85… some of the ideas came from  people like Loftus and me at RAND. That you needed to do something like that to  check on the overall resource demands implied by various kinds of programs that  the Soviets were undertaking. Anyway, there was quite active interchange with  them.  And then somehow, by the late ‘60s, it had pretty much dried up, I think. And I  think it came about, in part, because of, maybe this sense that, “We’re the real professionals and we don’t really need to keep up these connections.” Secondly, the  people in the ‘50s— The whole place was made up of people who were brought  in just a few years before. But by the late ‘60s, you were beginning to have people  rise fairly high in the bureaucracy who had come in and their whole careers had  been within the Agency.  And I remember, in fact, in the ‘60s, when I was brought on… Well, I was an Agency consultant from about ‘56, I guess, something. Anyway…I suppose it would  have been the early ‘60s… Under McCone an organization was formed called National Intelligence Programs Evaluation (NIPE), headed by John Bross, and it was  to look at the broadest management issues of the community as a whole. Bross  for some reason knew something about me—I don’t know exactly how that had  come about—but he invited me to come in to see him, and then he made me a  consultant of his. In fact, that was one of the most active relationships [indistinct] in the ‘60s. And he said to me once that it really worried him that this combination  of their having moved out to McLean and the fact that people in the Agency had  spent their whole professional lives in the Agency and didn’t know anybody, let  alone in the rest of the city, but in, you know, New York or wherever, really worried  him. He used to shake his head about what that was going to lead to, because of  his own experience and that it was very valuable to have contacts in other worlds,  whether it was on Wall Street or wherever it is that you can get information from.  And these people going up with these new careers didn’t have any of that.  
- Q1: Did the situation improve?  
- Marshall: “Consumer research” by the intelligence community has gotten a little  better over time. They now do some surveys of users; I don’t know that it really  influences what they do. It was striking how little interface or real knowledge they  had of what consumers wanted.  One of the things I did was to conduct a survey of people on the NSC staff about  what they wanted. Strengths, weaknesses, what things weren’t they getting that  they might want. Found they wanted, if they could get it, some of the products to  be focused on longer term trends, basic things that were happening, not the dayto-day events, more speculative about the future, but really thoughtful.  Producing such things runs up against the ethos of people in the intelligence  community, that they shouldn’t be speculating, that they should be getting hard  information and then at most interpreting that for the readers. But the actual  consumers wanted something rather different, at least in part. But the consumers  also wanted to know where there were controversies and differences of opinion  within the intelligence community.  But again, at that point, the community was devoted to the notion that they  should resolve their differences internally and kind of speak with one voice. But  also, I guess the thing that drove some of this stuff about these new institutions,  like the NSCIC [Eds: National Security Council Intelligence Committee], was this  dissatisfaction of Kissinger and Nixon with the products, that they just didn’t think  were very good and lacking real intellectual quality.  
- Q1: What was the background of your study of the quality of intelligence?  
- Marshall: When I was about to start work, I had another meeting with Kissinger in  which we reviewed again what he wanted done. And after discussion, one of the  things that I was asked to do as a second study was to make a judgment after  really looking at the assessments, estimates of the missile programs, because that  was the big thing that was happening… It had been left slightly open what particular area to pick to do this quality assessment. And it was then that essentially  the Soviet strategic missiles programs were picked. SS-9 was one of the biggest  of the issues. Questions about how many there were, what the characteristics of  the new systems were. And it wasn’t only just the technical things, but there were  issues of whether they had reloads, what was the motivation for moving to the  new systems…  
- Q1: I was just interested in why Kissinger was interested in the missiles assessment.
- Marshall: Well, I think I proposed it, because I knew that it was an area of interest to  him.  
- Q1: And you had a competence in the area.  
- Marshall: And he agreed with that.  
- Q1: What were your findings?  
- Marshall: I thought there were just a lot of limitations, I guess in the NIEs on Soviet  strategic forces. I’m a little vague at this point on my findings. It wasn’t a very  favorable report. In the sense that… There were things that they did report on  that represented the very skillful effort that was being made through various collection devices to analyze the programs, I mean in the sense of, you know, a new  silo was going in here or there, or, you know, “We see this at the test facilities at  Tyuratam,” and so on. Or various other technical analyses about the performance  of these missiles. But beyond that, there just wasn’t anything.  And I remember later, when I was working for Kissinger, not when I was doing  this study, there was a book called The Soviet Space Bluff [The Russian Space Bluff],  written by a defector [Leonid Vladimirov], which was filled with fascinating stuff,  giving you the names of the various designers. I mean the intelligence community was very late in providing any information about—I brought this book to the  attention of people in the Agency, but they never did anything about it, to go  interview this guy, or anything. I mean, he was living in England.  So, any sense of the personnel rivalries, the process by which these things were  designed, or about the organizations and so on…they didn’t provide anything.  Or they…We didn’t have any broad sweeping recommendations. We had some  recommendations which came out of this look at missile things, which led to this  proposal to do this prototype SS-9 study as an exemplar of the kind of the level of  analysis you would like to see.  
- Q1: Did your findings have an impact?  
- Marshall: Mmmm, ah, maybe a slight bit of improvement in subsequent NIEs as a  result of this exercise. I don’t know. The real improvement came with Larry Gershwin going out there. I mean it took that to make a real difference. He didn’t go out  there until Harry Rowen went out there. So it was the very early ‘80s.  
- Q1: What other areas of intelligence analysis needed improvement, in your opinion?  
- Marshall: One of the things I tried to get them to look at, like when they did this  special SS-9 study, was…try to get at things like the manpower costs associated  with different systems—Was that a motive for switching to newer systems or not?  They seemed to be content to just report, “Well, two more silos have started,” with  no interpretation of, “Why is that happening? What does that suggest?” Couldn’t  provide any insight about any of the internal processes that led to any of these  things.  Because I had requested it, they at least made an attempt to answer some of  these other kinds of questions. But again, it seemed to me that it was very important to understand the economics of this, I mean, what did these things really  cost? So, anyway, they made a stab at these things. Also, more about the relation of the SS-9 to the SS-7 and things like that, so you get some sense of the evolution of their systems and so on.  
- Q1: How long did the SS-9 study take?  
- Marshall: It was more like a year study, from spring 1970 to fall 1971.  
- Q1: Among the other special products for Kissinger, the main thing was the analysis  of key personalities?  
- Marshall: Biographic intelligence guidelines, if I remember correctly, it was kind of  a two-page form to be filled in that had headings, specifying the kind of information we wanted about the person. But I don’t think it ever had any impact at all.  In the first place, Henry had this great interest in these people that he might have  to deal with in one fashion or the other. One of the first things that came up was  this interest that he had in these psychological profiles that had been prepared  by Jerry Post and other people out at the CIA, which he wanted more of. He even  had the idea of some psychiatrist up in the Boston area, that was connected with  a very famous…this was a professional psychiatric clinic for the treatment of mental  diseases…I know about it from the work that I’d done with Herbert Goldhamer. It  existed way back in the 1830s, 1840s and it was a private place where people with  mental problems could go, as contrasted with the state system of asylums.86 Any -  way, so Kissinger even wanted to get more work and thought it would be interesting  for this guy to somehow get involved in this. So he wanted more effort. People in  the Agency were extremely reluctant, just didn’t consider it one of their top-ofthe-line products, a little disreputable…it’s speculative, it’s a little oddball, etc.  The thing that was striking to me was, OK, here’s something that Henry liked,  thought was useful, wanted more of, but essentially couldn’t get it.  And then when this coup took place, he was again… “Well, who are these  people…” And you have the background in the files, which is about, as I put it in  a kind of cynical way, sarcastic way… I mean it’s fine if you’re going to entertain  them, they like scotch or bourbon. It’s stuff that’s presumably acquired or written  down based on social contacts with these people, some sense of them, whether  they’re womanizers or not, but there’s nothing about what are they really like psychologically, as personalities, except sort of crude descriptors, you know, “A strong  person.” Nothing about ideological beliefs. So it’s very limited, it doesn’t show  any insight into the person at all. Just puts him in a category. You know, “Catholic,” “military officer,” “likes bourbon” or “likes rock-and-roll music.” No information  about his thinking, or how he might behave in certain circumstances.  
- Q1: The coup was in Panama?  
- Marshall: Maybe a “coup” is too dramatic a word. Takeover of the government by a  military officer, I think.  So Kissinger gets this stuff and they barely know much about these people.  Maybe only for one or two of them there’s even any data at all and what it is this  piffling material. So I get asked, “What could be done about this?” So I looked into  this, tried to understand a little more about how the thing worked, but only for a  few days. Then said, “Well, one thing you could do at least is write down what it is you want about these people, what would be useful to you.” And we did that and  sent it over.  
- Q1: Would greater use of the Bayesian method for analysis and communication  have improved intelligence analysis?  
- Marshall: Well again, that came up right at the beginning, because one of the  things that also came out of this early technique [?] was the way that uncertainties were handled in this kind of backhanded way of, in paragraph 28 they say  one thing and then they halfway take it back in paragraph 57. Uncertainty should  be more squarely faced, they should look for ways of presenting the thing. And  Kissinger was in favor of this even in saying, “Well, there are six alternatives and  here are our best guesses about the probabilities of those.” Well, they didn’t like  that at all.  
- Q1: Did they make some effort?  
- Marshall: Well, there were a couple of experiments to do that. But I think they were  kind of halfhearted. They were being forced to do something they didn’t like. At  the level of the Board of National Estimates, it was just seen as too crude and not  literary. That’s not the way you would try to convey any of these things. The Bayesian method is partly how you do analysis and partly how do you present the stuff.  
- Q1: Was the use of Bayesian methods driven by the studies by Kelly and Peterson?  
- Marshall: So those guys were…I guess Kelly, when I first met him, was at DARPA,  then he went off into this— There were a couple of small firms that were pushing  this sort of analysis and how you would do that kind of thing. There was another  guy that I knew from RAND that was at Michigan…Ward Edwards…a set of these  people. There was both the presentational kind of thing…the Bayesian kind of  thing… But then there was also a set of people out there that were working on  situations where you get information over time…and supposing you have a  set of estimates, the likelihood of various alternatives, and you get a new piece  of information, how do you modify each of these… In fact one thing I did was  I sponsored a conference out in Coronado in California. There people who had  been working in this field were all brought together…  
- Q1: Now, was this while you were at the NSC or afterward?  
- Marshall: Probably was after, because I think I got DARPA to put up the money,  yeah, probably soon after I got to the Pentagon. But Pat Crecine I remember was  there, this guy from Michigan.  
- Q1: Now what did Kissinger think of some of these experiments or the results of  these experiments?  
- Marshall: I forget now. I know that we got some and shipped them into him. But I  don’t think we got much of a reaction. I think we tried it out on some of the other  people and they sort of liked it, but it wasn’t as though they were entranced by it.  
- Q1: Were there other ways in which you tried to improve intelligence analysis?  
- Marshall: I made this big effort on organizational behavior, but I described some of  that in the earlier interview or session.
- Q1: While you were at the NSC?  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q1: Covering which topic?  
- Marshall: Well, the thing took two forms. One, there were a few people at the Agency  who were quite interested in it, particularly some of the people over in the clandestine services side, that I had gotten to know while I was at RAND, because they  had come to me to try to get some information about a country that I had a lot  of contact with, and so I had talked to them somewhat in the course of that. So,  after I was at the NSC, I said, “OK, look, here’s a way of doing analysis that might  be useful. I will try to tutor, in a way, although I don’t know what the right word  for it would be, some set of analysts, or some people, to try to make sure they  understand what it is they ought to try look at when they look at these organizations. What information do you really want to have?” And so on. So, three or four  of them came down several times and spent time talking about this. And then…  That was one thing. There were these people who were very interested in it, who  kind of picked it up, did whatever they did with it, I don’t know, they kind of disappeared back into the clandestine services. Never had much effect on the people  in the Directorate of Intelligence. There may be some papers around from that.  
- Q1: There was an informal group of CIA producers you convened in late 1972 to  determine data needed to support intelligence analyses based on theories of organizational and human behavior. One member of the group looked at a case of  using those methodologies to understand the French position in GATT [General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] discussions in late 1973. Was that the same group?  
- Marshall: Well, it was kind of the second phase of that. Because after we’d done  this other thing, just talking… What would you really want to know? I decided it  would be good to have a case that would be done, where they could show what  it was they could do. And it would be a kind of test of could they carry out something like this. Mainly the earlier discussions have been about, “Well, what do you  want to know? What are the kind of things you want to find out?” And so on. You’d  want to find out about the processes, who’s involved, things about the internal  procedures. But then it came to a point where we thought about, “Well, let’s do a  kind of test about what they can do.”  And the idea was—Or my idea was, “Well, look, a country I know about is France,  so let’s pick France.” It’s also, in principle, a country that we should be able to find  out a lot about. It’s not like Russia or China… So I went to see Ken [Kenneth W.]  Dam to discuss with him… He was a kind of special assistant to George Shultz,  who was then the Secretary of the Treasury, I think. But Dam had an office in the  White House…I don’t remember whether Shultz did. …I knew Dam quite well, so  I went to him and said, “What is a topic? What is something we could get them to  focus on?” And he said, “Well, look, something that would be interesting is French  agricultural policy.” And I know a lot about that… Because the idea was to pick  something that we [?] could judge how good this thing was. So we picked that.  I then proposed that—and I forget who it was that exactly I proposed it to—It  might have been Ed Proctor, who was still the head of the intelligence directorate.And he picked a guy who was retired. …I can’t remember the guy’s name now, but  he’s somebody who I’d known for a long time, who had an economics background  and had been in the Agency from way back in the ‘50s, had recently retired at this  point. Who had been a close friend to Joe Loftus. So had been up to RAND several  times. So I really knew him pretty well. So Proctor proposed that they get this guy  back out of retirement, and give him this job. And the idea was for the person to  draw on—not to have to do collection so much—what already was in the Agency.  What did they really know? Pull together everything they knew that would fit this  particular topic of their agricultural policy and their negotiations stances. And he  did this paper, which I thought was not really very good, and neither did Ken Dam,  because we both looked at it. Because it really didn’t take over this organizational  behavior thing, didn’t get down to the level that you need. But, anyway, it wasn’t  pursued anymore. I took it to be, “Look, these guys may not be up to doing this.”  
- Q1: How were intelligence products delivered to users?  
- Marshall: At the time, there was almost an exclusive reliance on the publications. I  think there always was a certain trickle of people who came down and met faceto-face with people. I don’t mean briefings, but coming to the office, talking with  them and so on. I think Frank Walters at the time felt there was too little of this,  and it’s not just that the intelligence person making some sort of presentation can  communicate more about what’s behind the thing, or can answer questions, but  also can come away with a better sense of what the people he’s talking to really  are interested in and care about.  Another thing I tried to have done—it kind of didn’t get anywhere—I thought  that there were some kind of topics that actually short videos would be better.  For example, instead of trying to describe, through writing or even verbally,  how a multiple-warhead system worked, that a short video that showed how it  worked would communicate a lot more. Or, I felt—and again, neither of these  things was done very well—thought that… Well, one of the things that seemed  to be happening at the time was that… Because of the split with the Russians, the  Chinese were moving their forces, and repositioning them more to the north and  so on, etc. And that, for example, if one, again, had a kind of even like a cartoon  version…or a map, and time-phasing showing, OK, here’s where all of these  forces were in the early ‘50s, here is… These units have moved from here, they’re  now over here… Or people have been taken from here and moved to there…  Fortification programs begun and various other things. That you would be able  to see if that kind of thing was just… The time-sequencing—You would see the  adjustment of the forces. You would see also the big expansion of the Russian  forces along the—That would tell you more… First, the analyst would probably  see things he might not otherwise see. But they would be a wonderful way of  presenting things to people at the top level.  I did have a primitive version of the MIRV thing done, that was never quite good  enough to show Henry, and the other one I kept asking people to do and never  succeeded in having it done. But I think there are just terrific possibilities in the  presentation of stuff other than having people just read these things or look at  static maps and so on. Everything we know about man’s evolutionary history is just tremendously focused on the eyes. Lionel Tiger says one of the reasons television is so compelling to people, as against reading, and is in some sense ruining  American education, as it is everyplace else, I guess, by competing for time with  people, is because people so prefer to get information… And the problem on  television is the information they get is so both inadequate and misguided that…  
- Q1: Any other presentation techniques?  
- Marshall: No, those were the main ones I think about.  Frank Walters was a CIA analyst, one of the good guys from the ‘50s that I knew  very well. I can’t remember exactly what his ideas were, but they’re probably like  this {…} briefings, face-to- face contact.  
- Q1: Could you describe the impact of the Schlesinger report on reform of the intelligence community and the role you played?  
- Marshall: I think it was in December of ‘70 that Nixon kind of instructed Shultz and  Kissinger to undertake this review. And then I think initially there was a March  reporting date, and then some decisions were supposed to be made in April-May  or something. Then it got postponed till later. And so you had the March 1971  Schlesinger report, which was kind of an interim report. Then there was further  work and a final report which made…87 And as I look at this thing it looks kind of  descriptive. And the thing that happened between this and the reports that came  out later… The later ones are focused more on recommendations about what to  do and kind of the rationale for the changes and so on. And while I was the NSC  representative on the thing in an actual way, I guess nominally Wayne Smith was,  but then he asked me to do it because I’d done these earlier intelligence studies  for Henry. And the bulk of the effort was done by the OMB people. What happened  at the end was, however, that Schlesinger had gone over to the AEC [Atomic  Energy Commission]—I forget the dates of that—I guess probably in September,  I wrote the final kind of summary that went up to Nixon. You know, Here’s what  is recommended, and also attached were the things he would sign, like a general  memo… A memo to Helms as to his new duties and what he was directed to do.  And I drafted all of that, because there wasn’t a comparable person over at OMB  because Schlesinger had left. …And there may have been the start of some kind  of a draft…I think there was a partial thing that…May well have been that Bill  Kaufmann had—Because he was acting as a consultant to Schlesinger at the time.  But all of that stopped when Schlesinger left and I took over to finish it. Then Haig  and Smith undertook to send it around to the OMB people, to whoever else they  thought they needed to go to…Bronson Tweedy…I’m not sure all the people.  And then a few changes and it was finalized… In fact, I prepared the final versions  and it was sent up through Smith and Kissinger, Haig, to Nixon to sign off on.  
- Q1: What happened after the recommendations went to Nixon?  
- Marshall: After the reorganization was put in place, improving community management, we were involved in monitoring the implementation of the reorganization,  and secondly, reviewing in selected areas the quality of the products.  I spent a lot of time talking with people up near Helms, who were involved in  making the changes, particularly a man named Bronson Tweedy and just following what they did. They had to set up this new IC staff, there were personnel issues.  We’d monitor that and periodically make reports to Kissinger about it. We were  often consulted by those people. That was the main thing.  We tried to do some things in the area of the training and management of analysis. One of the things we found was there was really no investment in the training  of analysts, or what there was was not very good.  On the management side, we looked at the issue of career lines. And only in  a few areas did people stay in their particular area. That happened in things  connected with the Soviet Union, but in other regional offices, people had very  little background. But again, even in the Soviet Union they had a group of people  dealing with the Soviet navy, but they turned over so rapidly that nobody there  ever got to have real expertise in the Soviet navy. So there’s this kind of incompatibility of the personnel system with getting really skilled people, knowledgeable  people doing analysis. We recommended that they look at that and see what they  wanted to do about that. We didn’t have any particular recommendations, we just  pointed out that there were really problems in terms of getting people to have  the intellectual capital to do a good job.  I mean, what it comes back to in my mind— It shows also the virtue of lateral entry. I mean, again, one of the big problems with the career system out there is it’s  kind of based on the idea of getting younger guys—of course, it wasn’t formed  that way as an agency—and that’s one of the reasons the Agency was a lot better  in the ‘50s than I think it was later. They saddled themselves for security reasons, I  guess, among other things, with a career system in which people were supposed to  come in from universities. And a number of them just had undergraduate degrees.  And kind of progress up and kind of learn on the job, and so on. Well, you’re not  necessarily going to get great analysts out of them.  
- Q1: Particularly if you’re not paying attention to training.  
- Marshall: That’s right. So the big thing about Larry Gershwin was, first, he was technically better trained than most of the people they’d had looking at the missile  programs, or the strategic forces programs and he’d shown real analytic ability,  and was brought in by Harry Rowen at my suggestion. They have a fundamental  problem of just the intellectual capacity and analytic capabilities of the people  they have. That means you can organize, you can invest, you can do certain kinds  of things well with a career system of that sort, but there are other things you  can’t do very well. So you can run collection systems and so forth…American  intelligence is relatively strong on collection and weak on analysis.  
- Q1: To this day?  
- Marshall: I think so, but I don’t pay very much attention to it anymore. But I look at  it and it doesn’t seem any better, but I don’t pay that much attention.  And then the other thing we called their attention to was some possibilities of  new training type techniques, this method developed at RAND, reproducing  scoring systems, to judge how much people really knew about areas, how good  they were at reporting, how certain or uncertain they were about the answers they gave. But all that just frightened them, they didn’t want anything to do with  anything. This was people down in the organization, not Tweedy.  Later when I was working for Henry, and Chip Pickett and I—in fact you might  talk to Chip about it—we had all of these misgivings about the personnel system,  about training, and we tried to communicate some of those in a variety of ways  to the people out there. But, you know, they were not really that inclined to do  anything. I mean, that meant changing something that was very basic in the organization and it would take a lot of effort, it would be a really big change.  When we did encourage some of this lateral entry—I encouraged Schlesinger in  that direction and he did a little bit of it… And then later, particularly under Casey,  still more of it was done. I don’t know what’s happening now.  
- Q1: Did you have any role in preparing the new National Security Intelligence Directives (NSCIDs) that followed the Schlesinger report?  
- Marshall: Not that I remember, I don’t think so. It might well have been the special  group over in OMB, but I’m not actually sure who did the drafting.  
- Q1: The NSCIC just met once or twice?  
- Marshall: Yeah, probably. It may have met some after Kissinger and I left. But that’s  right, I can only remember one meeting, actually, when I was there.  
- Q1: Did the infrequent meetings of the NSCIC result in a lack of direction given to  the intelligence community by decisionmakers?  
- Marshall: When I tried to get from Kissinger, “Well, what do you really want” and so  on, we didn’t get very much. I mean we’d get these kind of gripes about how bad  the stuff is and so on, but you couldn’t get them to sit down and put together…  You might talk with Chip Pickett about that.  He was around. I can’t remember whether we tried to send out some kind of  request for a statement of what they most wanted. The only thing that, as I say,  worked was this survey I did of the NSC staff, and through them you get what  they would have liked and what they thought Kissinger would find useful. I sent  the results out to the people at CIA.  
- Q1: What did they do with it?  
- Marshall: At the moment, not very much. There was one thing that was requested  by the people who followed the Soviet Union, which we put a special effort on.  That was to create a new product, which was called something like “The Forum” or  something like that. Which was to come out maybe once a month and contain an  expression of views of people on some major controversy that existed. And they  hated it, and they continued it for a while and dropped it at the first opportunity.  But we did get to do it for about four, five, six months, something like that.  
- Q1: So there was just massive resistance across the board, or inertia?  
- Marshall: Right. Well, over time I think they’ve improved. They do some of their  own surveys now. I don’t think they’re as—And they have sent people around  to talk with people. And so they’ve picked up on some of it. I don’t know that it  really affects what they end up doing, that is the kind of products they produce. But they go through the process anyway. They didn’t do anything. They didn’t do  anything before.  
- Q1: You mentioned earlier that the Net Assessment Group was included in the intelligence reorganization document when it was brokered around by Smith and Haig.  
- Marshall: But it was not in my draft.  
- Q1: The March 1971 version of the Schlesinger report calls for a net assessment  function.  
- Marshall: I had forgotten about that, but it wasn’t, I know, in the other version that I  drafted that included recommendations.  
- Q1: Lionel Olmer gave a talk at Harvard in 1980 in which he claimed that the  President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) wanted net assessment  performed by the NSC, but that Kissinger was resistant.  
- Marshall: Well, as I told you, there were several sources of a push to do that. I think  I told you of these people who were involved in the Blue Ribbon Panel… The  three people that visited me from the Blue Ribbon Panel were on the staff. After  the fact, I talked with Ruben Mettler because I had been told that for the Blue  Ribbon Panel report that he had been the one that had pushed for this thing [net  assessment] within the DoD structure. But these people came over…and it was  before I finished. So it was early ‘70, probably March, maybe April. They had somehow heard the fact that Henry had me doing this, came over, and lobbied for me  to put in my recommendations to him this reestablishment of a net assessment  group at the NSC. But I didn’t have any strong sense of— I didn’t personally feel  that that was the big thing. Maybe it would be good, maybe not, I don’t know. But  it didn’t fit with the things I was actually coming to, issues I was then addressing.  
- Q1: Was the 6 December 1971 directive from Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird  what you were referring to when you said that Laird issued a directive creating  a Director of Net Assessment at the Pentagon the day after Nixon’s intelligence  memo came out?  
- Marshall: Maybe we didn’t see this and maybe it took this time… But we knew right  away that he had decided to do this. …I forget how we knew.  
- Q1: Before that he hadn’t acted at all on the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel?  
- Marshall: No, he had not.  
- Q1: Why do you think he was so opposed to setting up a net assessment function?  
- Marshall: I don’t know that he was strongly opposed. But he probably wasn’t  strongly for it. I don’t know. Actually, the most interesting guy to talk to about it is  dead—Fred Buzhardt. When I was over at the NSC trying to get the net assessment process started, he was one of the really helpful people at the Pentagon and  he was very close to Laird.…But I don’t know who you could talk to about that.  
- Q1: What’s your general assessment of the result of the 1971 reorganization?  
- Marshall: Well, it’s so long ago, and so many other things have intervened. I don’t  know. It’s hard to—Certainly it changed eventually, but only eventually. I think the top-level management of the community—It’s hard to say that it’s—on issues  that matter, or the thing I have the best sense about, the quality of analysis—It’s  hard to say that it’s had that much effect. I mean in some areas—But it’s more this  matter of personnel, various people, like Gershwin, or some of the NIOs [National  Intelligence Officers] they’ve had in the general-purpose forces, I mean, Gorman was there for a while—sensible thing—the current guy— But I’m not close  enough to that set of organizations anymore to judge. But it certainly happened  very slowly.  
- Q1: But I mean from your perch at the NSC, when you were responsible for monitoring what was happening?  
- Marshall: Oh, well, then, not very much happened at all. I mean it went very, very  slowly. I mean because Helms was being asked to take on responsibilities that he  didn’t really want. Set up new organizations like the IC staff. But it all went very  slowly, very slowly. And, as I say, two years later, which was essentially when I left,  not a lot had happened, I would say.  
- Q1: This was very helpful.  
- Marshall: Well, we can have further sessions. 

### 1969–1973

- Q1: So you joined the NSC full time in 1972 as head of the Net Assessment Group?  
- Marshall: ‘Course, I mean, initially it was just me. And then Carol Doheny. And then  I recruited Chip Pickett, who must have come in the summer [July ‘72], and then a  few months later, Robin Pirie. And then we had this other–Then Carol had gotten  Jo Hunerwadel assigned. But she was someone who came on as one of the  regular NSC secretaries. Then when Carol left, then she moved up to be the senior  secretary and we got this other secretary, Lexi Crow. And the five of us moved  over here.  Let me say that one of the things that happened was that when I got the position  as head of the NSC Net Assessment Group, a number of people came around to  talk to me. Kind of give me advice. One of the most interesting was General Polk,  and I mentioned some other things about his insight from his own time as the  commander of the ground forces in Europe. His approach was driven by the fact  that he thought it was very important to know how effective these other forces  really were, something about their typical mistakes or failings, and so on, and etc.  And I guess the things I remember the most him talking about were these stories  that he got, and were indicative of the difficulties they had in movement—When  a unit was going to move from one place to the other, they would send out ahead  of them people that were almost the equivalent of traffic directors to make sure  they make the right turn at that crossroad, this crossroad. And then episodes of  them still getting lost, or making the wrong turn. These were all kind of indicators  to him of particular failings, problems that they were having. His point was that,  here he was, he was the commander of the American ground forces, and when  he asked his—down through his intelligence organizations, to tell him about  how good the opposing forces were, I mean qualitatively and so on, he was very  dissatisfied with what he got back. And that’s why he undertook this personal effort to find out for himself. And I forget whether it was he or George Blanchard [a  subsequent commander of the American ground forces] telling me later of things  they thought about, planned to impress the Russian commander. Efforts were  made to invite the counterpart commander to come over and then to either in a  seemingly casual way or in a kind of staged way to kind of do things that would  impress him, like the speed at which certain kinds of actions could be taken and  executed and so on.  I don’t remember specifically who [other than General] Polk came by to see me].  But I was struck by the fact that all of a sudden there were a bunch of people  coming by to see me.  
- Q1: Could you talk about the review of combat models you did as part of the net  assessment work at NSC?  
- Marshall: What I looked at was—To look at combat models—Well, I thought that  given what the fundamental task was, I wanted to see whether the models of  combat, and you know, at the, I suppose, division and above level, not very micro  combat, what the state of affairs was. Were they adequate? Would they reflect all of the factors that really ought to go into such an assessment? And so, I guess I  got briefed on the state of modeling and the existing models and fairly—First, I  more or less decided on my own, but I consulted with a number of people as to  their appraisal, and would the things really deal with the full range of factors that  ought to be taken into account, and decided that they weren’t going to be able  to. That, in particular, they didn’t take into account these kinds of levels of training,  morale, leadership, any of the more qualitative factors. I remember talking with  General Polk about the state of the models.  
- Q1: You also conducted several intelligence case studies?  
- Marshall: The idea was—You know, it was one of the general tasks of this new NSC  Intelligence Committee to do these appraisals of the performance of the intelligence community. And we had started out with the performance in these crises.  The studies of crises would have been done from…Beginning spring or summer  of ‘72 and done into the early part of ‘73—I mean the ones we had planned.  The attempted overthrow of King Hussein and outside intervention in that crisis  was one of the case studies. The 1971 Indo-Pak war was another one. The other  case that I remember that we looked at was this…I forget the name of it. But  there was this period when there was this canal zone area in which the Egyptians  were supposedly not to—That the demilitarized strip, I guess, on the other side of  the canal—And they were not supposed to move into this area. But they began  surreptitiously to do so. And the issue was how well American intelligence was  able to monitor that—as I remember that. You ought to talk with Chip about  that, but I think…But I don’t remember NSSM 69 as being something that we  were that involved in. But there was a phrase for this encroachment back into this  demilitarized zone.  I don’t remember the specific insights from the case studies. But the things led  to a certain number of proposals of things that ought to be done in order to  do better in the future and so on. But as to the major insights, I guess that I felt  that what came out of it was this thing you mentioned [that the analysts did not  have the same perspective as Nixon and Kissinger]. But also how difficult it was  to get the intelligence community people to really do objective assessments of  their own performance. The first draft almost uniformly came back, Given all the  circumstances, we did well, even if it was manifest that they hadn’t done very well.  They always had some out; you know, the circumstances prevented them from  doing well. So we usually had to go through two or three drafts before you could  finally get them to be a bit more objective and really do an appraisal from which  there would be some admission that this or that didn’t go so well and maybe  something that could be done about it.  
- Q1: You commented in the past that the post-mortems found a lack of objectivity  by the staff drawn from operating organizations; perishable data; lack of access to  top officials; sensitivity of certain activities.  
- Marshall: Yeah, I think there was a memo around here, there was probably something written toward the very end of—You know, what did we learn from this  whole thing and so on.
- Q1: And the case studies were followed by the study of intelligence in the 1973  Arab-Israeli War?  
- Marshall: And then along came this other event in ‘73, that we then took advantage  of. And we did the Arab-Israeli War study because one of the difficulties that we’d  found in doing the earlier assessments was that you often couldn’t really find out  which intelligence document or bits of things had actually reached particular  people, whether they had read them or not, and so on. So this was an attempt to  have a better feel for what materials actually reached the relevant people. And  then also to interview them while the thing’s going on as to how useful and so on  the stuff was. The study was done almost in real time. Talk more with Chip Pickett.  And actually, you see, Chip stayed on after the rest of the group came over here,  because our movement over here was not too much afterwards. And he stayed  on to finish the report and then came over. So he was a lot more involved. He’d be  the better person to talk to about that.  But at any rate, so we’d been looking at one aspect of the performance of the  community, and I think at some meeting of the second level of this thing, the  working group [of the NSCIC], discussed, Well, what other areas could we look at.  And one area was the quality of political and economic intelligence. And then the  question was, OK, we need to pick a country or some place to look at. And then  several proposals were made and Yugoslavia was picked, because at the time,  even though it didn’t happen until much later, again there was some speculation  that Tito—I forget whether it was his health or what it was—but he might leave  soon. And so, it was a kind of case of, or a situation in which you would like to  have good information about these things.  So, we then undertook this effort and, I guess as I remember it, we collected all this  stuff. You know, recent intelligence or probably from the prior couple of years or  so. And the materials, both various studies, or major papers, as well as current intelligence…We went and tried to understand, “Who were the people who prepared  this?” particularly at CIA, and some of their characteristics, I mean, did they really  know anything about Yugoslavia. I mean, what was the basis of their knowledge.  
- Q1: What yardsticks did you use?  
- Marshall: Well, whether they had previous experience, had ever lived in the country,  knew any of the languages, you know. But we had this body of material. And then  we had some people from the outside—and I forget who they all were, except for  a couple of them that I—although they weren’t the only ones—For the economics stuff, the one person I remember involving was Joe Kirchheimer, who was a  friend of mine and secondly, a partner in Burnham & Company on Wall Street, had  been in the CIA in the ‘50s, had been in military intelligence in the war.  
- Q1: In other words, he was very qualified.  
- Marshall: Yes, right. He was one of the people we had look at the—But he wasn’t  the only one. There were two or three other people. We had a little panel of two  or three people for each, separately, for the economics and the political. And on  the political side, I remember that one of the people was Nathan Leites. But I can’t  quite remember who the other people were. And, in essence, we got pretty negative reviews from the panel after reading all  this stuff. In both cases. In the case of the economic material…just thought that  there was better material that could be available to people in the government  from the banks on Wall Street, is the most particular thing I meant, but there were  undoubtedly other sources. And then for the political analysis, it was just felt that  there was very good reporting in Swiss and German newspapers, and just translating the articles from the better newspapers would be a lot better than the stuff  there. Now, of course, there would be a tiny bit of material based on some special  intelligence, say, that the newspapers wouldn’t necessarily have. But it would  be—The bulk of what these people tried to write about was done far better by  people out in the real world.  
- Q1: And these outside sources had been ignored, neglected by the intelligence  community?  
- Marshall: Well, probably. Yeah, I doubt that they read them.  Well, in the first place, again, Yugoslavia—Well, it turned out that the people who  did this were part of the current intelligence people at CIA. Again, I think the  reporting from the clandestine service people at the embassy and so on would  have not had some of these difficulties. But these panels didn’t look at that. They  looked at the part that came out of the so-called intelligence analysis…But that  was done by people in the current intelligence part of CIA, and there, particularly  for countries like Yugoslavia, it was treated like almost a newspaper. There was the  Yugoslavian desk, and there would be two or three people on it. But they moved  from that to other jobs, or from other jobs to that. But they had no prior experience dealing with Yugoslavia. They only tended to—At the moment we wrote the  report, the years of even being on that desk, the average for the three people was  a year and a half. So they weren’t there long enough to get great know-how. They  probably didn’t read German. So sending them to German and Swiss newspapers  was not going to help unless there were some readily available translations. They  didn’t know the languages.  And it was again an insight to me that—And we talked to one of the people on  the NSC, who actually was the recipient of this stuff, the intelligence stuff, who  had twice served in Yugoslavia, in the embassy, and so he had about nine years  or so of on-the-spot experience in Yugoslavia. So it was an example to me of how  wrong—There was this book called Organizational Intelligence or something, I  forget the name of the author now.  
- Q1: Wilensky?  
- Marshall: Yeah, some name like that. But the point is—Walinsky or Wilensky—89 See  the people…The kind of academic theorists sort of treat the world as being that  there are these people, the real experts, and things are filtered up to other people  who are not really in touch with the real world and also don’t know very much  about it. And that the problem in organizations is that the people who really know  certain kinds of things, some part of it gets filtered out as it moves up to the top.  Here you had this case of the people down below just don’t know very much,  don’t have much interpretive skill, sending stuff up to, in this case, someone who actually had a good deal of experience and knew more about the country than  they did. And it’s the product of the personnel systems in the intelligence community for these smaller countries. I mean in the case of—If you have other kinds  of situations, where people can specialize for a long time, as in the case of Russia  and so on, it’s not as big a contrast.  
- Q1: Back on the Yugoslavia review. When was that done roughly?  
- Marshall: I think that was probably done in the spring of ‘73, would be my guess.  
- Q1: What impact do you think these different studies had or how were they used?  
- Marshall: Well, you know, again, they were sent out from this NSC committee. First,  to the members on the committee itself, because they were done by the working  group. So all the major organizations were represented there…Well, I guess not  all, because I guess NSA wasn’t on it or so on. But then it went out. But you know,  again, it’s just another report and I don’t think very much happened as a result of  that. But Chip would be good on this, I mean he was the main collaborator…  
- Q1: On all of these studies, rather than Robin Pirie?  
- Marshall: Oh yeah, Robin was off…We were trying to get the net assessment part  of it going.  
- Q1: In your notes, you wrote: “History: — HAK • GPF [general-purpose forces] backup plan, leads to CIA work.”  
- Marshall: Well, I would guess—There had been this work that was done for Kissinger  in the summer of ‘70, you know, the initial net assessment. And the whole motive  that he had was that he wanted this study done in order to have some things in  his hip pocket, so to speak, of programs that could be either augmented or so on,  etc., that would be worthwhile, if things did not go well with the Soviets and new  monies were available and…  So part of the background was that, OK, if you’re going to have these—This idea  that if things go badly you’re going to start some new things, they might as well  be things that would be impressive.  
- Q1: Now is this if things went badly in SALT or just a general deterioration in our  relations with…?  
- Marshall: I forget now what was worrying Kissinger. I suppose it was SALT or just  general behavior that kind of things…  
- Q1: There was a stalemate in the SALT talks around the time you started work on the  net assessment study and also there were the crises discussed earlier.  
- Marshall: But in any case, I had had this—From the beginning on this idea of the  net assessments—That is, that clearly one of the ways…One of our goals was  deterring the Soviets from various kinds of actions, encroachments, and so on.  And that it would be important to understand, what did they pay attention to,  where did they give us good marks, where did they not give us good marks. And  so, once I had joined Kissinger, I thought more about that. And then asked that  this study be done to make an attempt to answer those kinds of questions. 
- Q1: And what were the findings? I know it [the study] was completed after you  moved to the Pentagon.  
- Marshall: Well, as I remember it, I think there were a couple of reports that came  out…Again, I remember that there were some things that came out…There  certainly was some insights as to what it was they seemed particularly to pay  attention to and so on. But I don’t remember the details of the thing. But as I  remember, I thought the things were OK, and yet they were seen as difficult to  do, and the guy who did them I think moved on to something else, and they were  never kind of continued.  
- Q1: But there was just one person working on them?  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.90  
- Q1: Do you remember why Kissinger wanted the study of the Chinese ballistic  missile program done?  
- Marshall: No. In fact, it had been ordered before I had come on board. But it was one  of the first things that came in, when I came on board in early January of ‘72. And it  was one of the things that I was asked to evaluate. Well, also it was a special study  that had been asked for by him. And I don’t remember what triggered it. I remember reviewing it and sending up an appraisal of it to Kissinger. And then…The thing  that was so ironic about it was that, here in this study they, in effect, say that they  haven’t deployed the missiles yet…At that time they believed that the Chinese  hadn’t deployed any missiles [MRBMs, IRBMs or ICBMs]. That they hadn’t been  deployed, and went into a long story about why they were so sure in saying, we  would have seen this, we would have seen that. And all based on the assumption  that they would proceed very much the way we and the Russians had. And then a  relatively few months—within six months, I think—they had to come in and say,  “Whoops, we now know they’ve been deployed more than that. They have been  deployed since about 1965. Now that we see what they’re doing” and so on, etc.  
- Q1: This is because they’re road-mobile missiles and they’re dispersed?  
- Marshall: Well, they’re different in their—Right—and they’re hidden in a variety  of ways and so on, etc. And obviously the Chinese had taken great care to be far  more deceptive about the whole business than either we or the Russians actually  had been. And, very likely, in my judgment, because they were actually apprehensive about the Russian reaction had it been detected.  
- Q1: Possible attack.  
- Marshall: Yeah.  
- Q1: But the problem, was it that the CIA was saying, “Well, here’s the setup of the  missile at the test site, and that we don’t see that duplicated in the field. And so,  therefore, it hasn’t been deployed?”  
- Marshall: Well, or that they’ve had certain kinds of tests, but, you know, that they  probably would deploy—We would see at the test site the kind of silos, the kind  of things that they would eventually deploy. And we don’t see that. We don’t see  any deployed systems that match anything. We don’t see anything that looks like  what we see at the test sites, and so on, etc. 
- Q1: Do you remember if the misestimate of the size of the SS-19 ICBM occurred  during the May ‘72 Moscow summit?  
- Marshall: No, I don’t think it occurred during it. But it—The reason I remember it  was there was a strong reaction on Haig’s part, I think, because we were making,  in the negotiations, a big point of some particular measure of size, and if what this  new revelation meant, and everything, that this had been set—the size thing—  had been set based on our notions of the earlier estimate of the size, which was  smaller…And so, in effect, we either said, we were kind of complicating the negotiation by trying to force on them a size category which meant that the –19 would  be, in fact, a big missile, or you’re forcing them to lie and to… At any rate…  
- Q1: And Haig was upset about this?  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q1: But the main point was that these were just examples of where the intelligence  community got things wrong?  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.  
- Q1: What were the general contents of the five-page handwritten letter you wrote  to Schlesinger when he became Director of Central Intelligence?  
- Marshall: Well, the main thing I guess I recall about it was kind of saying to him—  ‘Course Schlesinger already, because of his previous position at OMB, where he’d  overseen a lot of—I mean the people who monitored intelligence were under  him and so on. And I, of course, had talked with him from time to time anyway  about it. But I guess the main thrust of the letter was to say to him, “Look, this is an  organization which isn’t as good as it used to be. It has a lot of problems,” and try  to outline a number of problems based on the experience that I had had of the  inadequacies in the analysis area, its tendency to isolate itself from the outside  world in terms of very little lateral entry, all of that. I just kind of laid all that out for  him, as to the kind of place he was taking over and what seemed to be the kind of  major problems, the obstacles to change, and so on.  
- Q1: Even at the NSC, you were criticizing the intelligence community for its estimates of the Soviet defense burden.  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q1: And what do you remember about your work on that subject while you were at  the NSC?  
- Marshall: Well, it was…I mean I didn’t do very much about it there, as compared  with later, when I came here. But I had had doubts about it back at RAND. In fact,  Schlesinger and I had talked some about that. And we also talked about it when  we did that net assessment for Kissinger in the summer of ‘70, or probably early  fall. And it just was unbelievable that they could produce the size of military  effort, be modernizing at the kind of pace they seemed to be, all on six percent  of a GNP which was smaller than ours. Again, it was based on the notion that it  was about half ours, for the moment, accepting that the GNP was about the size  that the CIA said it was, which would make it about half of the U.S. GNP. With only  six percent of that being allocated, which would be roughly the equivalent of three percent of our GNP, that they could produce this very large set of military  programs. So Schlesinger and I felt that there was something doubtful about that,  going way back. And nothing I learned made me feel any better about it.  
- Q1: But this wasn’t something that you studied, I mean a formal study or asking the  intelligence community to relook, look at it again at that time.  
- Marshall: No. That was done largely here, initially when Schlesinger came here and  we started pressing this as one of the issues with them. Which led to their relook  at it, and coming back to us in, I suppose, ‘74, with this special memorandum, it  wasn’t a regular report, it came back initially as just a memorandum to Schlesinger, that we’ve looked at it, and we think the errors, we still believe the number and  the errors would be very small on either side of it.  Q1: You had thought that the 1966 paper on Problems of Estimating Military Power  might have been related to work for Fred Wikner.  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q1: But really the other work that you did—and I’ll talk with him—  
- Marshall: Is later.  
- Q1: Much, much later.  
- Marshall: Well, so probably wasn’t, yeah. So, I suppose it must have just come out  of the, at one level, the work that I had been doing for a long time with Loftus,  although that had pretty much stopped at that point. Loftus and I put out some  final reports I think that we did together in ‘63. Then I went off to France.  Didn’t return until February or March of ‘65. And one of the main things that I  wanted to pick up at that point was trying to apply whatever was known about  organizations, organizational behavior. Which interest, in a way, had started in  the work with Loftus, had started back in the late ‘50s. And we did spend a lot of  time, or I spent a lot of time, thinking about how to understand the Soviets from  that perspective. But exactly why that thing [Problems of Estimating Military Power]  looks the way it is, I don’t know. Or why the topic is exactly what it is.  
- Q1: As Director of Strategic Studies at RAND, you were responsible for sort of  integrating the efforts related to strategic forces that were done in the different  departments at RAND?  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q1: So this was a new layer of management?  
- Marshall: Yes, it was a new thing that had come out of discussions that Schlesinger  and I had had with Rowen, which led to Rowen initially asking Schlesinger to  undertake this. And he did that for, maybe realistically, for six months. He hadn’t  gotten very far along in it when the 1968 election came along, and then he came  back on some of the transition team things and then ended up going into the  government here. So Rowen asked me to take it on. That was in early ‘69, I think,  because initially, when Schlesinger came back here during the transition period,  it wasn’t known whether he’d come back. The expectation initially was that he  would probably come back. So he [Schlesinger] probably knew about the offer to be assistant director in the Bureau of the Budget and accepted it in, I don’t know,  middle of January, late January, and shortly afterwards Rowen asked me to take  on the thing.  And so I looked at—I’m not sure exactly all of what Schlesinger had done, or I  don’t remember exactly. But anyway, one of the things I did was to get a kind  of a readout of, Well, who is doing work at RAND, and charging it off against, or  claiming that he’s working on strategic nuclear forces? And it was a very motley  assortment, because there had been no overall real direction.  And Schlesinger, I think, hadn’t gotten far enough along to really take hold of  this. And so I then started to think about, Well, what should a program in this area  really look at? What are the issues that you would want to have work being done  on? And so on, etc. And then it all kind of came out kind of naturally. And then I  had formed a small kind of discussion and planning group of not everyone who  claimed he was working in this area, but—and I even forget exactly who was on  it, but it was a small group of three or four people, probably. I had these ideas and  tried them out there, and then said, more or less said, Well, here’s the way I think  you really ought to look at this thing. Here’s a—In some sense we’ve been in this  kind of competition in this area for twenty years or more already and it’s going to  go on for a long time and we maybe need to look at it a different way and so on.  And so it kind of led to that set of ideas.  And internally…I don’t know what the records show…My memory is that it…The  whole thing, at least in an early form, was written down by the end of the summer  of ‘69. And then I had this call from Kissinger’s office asking me to stop by, and I  was on my way to a vacation in France. And I stopped by in probably about the  third week of September and had a session with Kissinger and then went on my  way and was gone about a month and came back. And then when I came back I  continued to try to sort out things on this program, but I was also being badgered  by Kissinger to come back and get on with this study and so on, which I did in the  early part of December of ‘69.  
- Q1: Do you remember what kind of reaction you got from the Air Force, or from the  small group at RAND that you were meeting with?  
- Marshall: Well, they…I don’t know…The group at RAND, I mean the people I talked  to, thought that was interesting. But I think it was never particularly picked up or  taken anywhere at RAND. I got several letters and notes from people in the Air  Force who liked it, thought it was interesting. But that’s about it, as I remember.  But, as I say, my memory is—  I don’t know whether anything shows up in that summer of ‘69. But essentially  it seems in my own mind a lot of it was done then, or the essence of it had been  worked out.91 But then I went away. Did some more probably when I got back.  And there was also a lot of practical stuff of trying to get the monies allocated,  because I, in principle, now controlled the budget. “In principle,” I say, because  there was not a very effective apparatus for doing that. And then I went away.  And then over ‘70, I mean I did the thing for Henry, the two reports, the last report  was finished very early in May. It was essentially the same time as the Cambodian enterprise was started. I then came back to RAND. But then quite soon there was  this…Two things: one, there was the SS-9 study that he accepted, and I ran that,  coming back from time to time and doing it, and then this effort that started in  the summer of ‘70 on these standby programs and the net assessment.  And then in December came this direction from Nixon to Henry and Shultz about  the reform of the intelligence community. And that started another cycle of my  commuting back and spending a lot of time there.  
- Q1: So how much time did you really have to devote to shaping the interdepartmental research program on strategic studies?  
- Marshall: Well, I mean it was hard, given all of these other things, and probably, you  know—  
- Q1: How did you decide on the topic for the NSSM 186, the first net assessment?  
- Marshall: Well, we had had a long struggle to get the whole thing going, because  Laird kind of dragged his feet on it, I talked a lot to Buzhardt, and also Laird had as  a special assistant this guy who…I forget his name…Baroody…But I dealt mainly  with Buzhardt, but I had some meetings with Baroody.  And both of them, I think, wanted to move ahead or be reasonable, but they—I  never really talked to Laird about it, but I mean he clearly resisted the idea of the  thing. So in the end, the way the things were going to be done was, while they  would be run from the NSC, the actual work would be farmed out to the most  relevant and interested party. We had a little working group…A guy named Al  Hall, who was here in the Pentagon…  
- Q1: He was like the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence.  
- Marshall: Yeah. And he also had been involved in this working group, for this NSCIC.  So when we finally worked out a process that Defense would buy, then came the  question of picking a topic. And I’m not sure exactly why we picked the ground  forces. It may have been, Well, this is an area, let’s just start with it, and some  things probably favored it and so on. More work had been done looking at—not  real net assessments—but looking at the nuclear forces… So, anyway, that ended  up being picked as a reasonable one to start with, and see how this whole thing  was going to go.  But it was started very late. It was started probably just…at most six months  before I moved over here.  
- Q1: In fact, this NSSM 186 is dated 1 September 1973.  
- Marshall: Hmmm, yeah, right. So anyway, just a few months, right. But probably—It  had been so slow to have the whole thing come together that the people were  more or less in place, and a contract was put out to BDM to do a lot of stuff. That’s  how Phil Karber and all these guys… They had an office down in the basement  someplace here and they got going.  
- Q1: Now did they do most of the work for the initial ground force net assessment?  
- Marshall: Well, a lot of it, yeah, right. 
- Q1: And then they continued after that?  
- Marshall: Yeah, right. That’s right, that contract. And I took that over and it became  a long-standing contract.  
- Q1: Do you know when you first started thinking about net assessment?  
- Marshall: I mainly wrote the 1970 net assessment, although Schlesinger spent a  little time on it. And there were people around—I mean, again, Charlie Herzfeld  was around, always pushing the idea of doing it. So I was thinking about it, and I’d  done that earlier paper on measuring military power, and so on.  In a more systematic way, it would be for Wikner back in… [when Marshall wrote  his report on comparisons and R&D strategy, part of a larger RAND effort.] And at  the time I did not particularly aspire to do that and so on. I thought it was interesting,  important, to try to have some way of measuring the comparative capabilities, and I  clearly didn’t think most of these simplified approaches did very much. And I guess  I had—A lot of my interest in it grew out of this interest in the Soviet Union, but  in this organizational assessment, I mean of how much of both what people did,  how effective they were, depended on these organizational matters. But I hadn’t  any, did not envisage, or I wasn’t particularly pushing the idea of setting up an office to do these things and so on. [indistinct] a good idea that somebody ought to  do, but I didn’t—At the time I was far more interested in the intelligence problems  and in this…different ways of looking at these issues of “doing well,” like the longterm competition set of ideas and in this application of these ideas coming out of  an organizational, almost social-cultural kind of perspective on these issues.  
- Q1: Did you also write a study of possible U.S. responses to Soviet threats against  China with Richard Kennedy while working for Kissinger?  
- Marshall: It was almost a drafting of a little paper on the thing, appraisal for—Well,  and a recommendation about what we should do, I guess, which I didn’t think I  had any special competence in, but got dragged into by Kennedy.  
- Q1: In Kissinger’s memoirs, and other sources, he mentions that at this time, early  1970, the NSC was doing a study of contingency planning for what the United  States should do if there were a war between the Soviet Union and China.  
- Marshall: Yes.  
- Q1: Now was this small effort that you and Kennedy worked on related to that?  
- Marshall: Well, I presume it was right at the beginning, because what he and I did, as  I remember, took place in December of ‘69. I came to kind of start this other stuff,  and was just kind of getting organized to do all of these studies and so on, etc.  And this issue came up of the Russian—I don’t know, I forget—approaches to us,  but anyway, threats against the Chinese.  
- Q1: That was really in the late summer and fall of ‘69.  
- Marshall: That’s right. But somehow or another it had become an issue just at that  moment. And so, Kennedy indicated to me that Kissinger would like me to participate. So it was kind of like being dragged off to the side, from the main thing I  was there to do, to just think through with him, you know, how should we react, what might we do and so on, and a little paper was prepared, which I participated  in the drafting of. And it was sent into Kissinger, and after that I never knew what  happened.  
- Q1: But what did you recommend in this short paper?  
- Marshall: I’m a little vague on that, you know. But my guess is that one of the things  was, Well, you really ought to start some planning, some thinking what do you  really do if…I think it was kind of to discourage the Russians, but also think about  what you can do. But I don’t have any clear memory of that.  
- Q1: This is just for completeness. Make sure that what you want to say is in the book.  
- Marshall: Yes, right.  
- Q1: Could you talk about your work on deception?  
- Marshall: I’d had this long-term interest in deception as a very important thing. And  probably when I was at the NSC, I forget whether I had any money to do it, but I  encouraged the people out at the Naval Postgraduate School, there were several  people out there who were interested in it, ended up with a—you know there’s a  volume on deception and so on.  
- Q1: So that grew out of your support for—  
- Marshall: Well encouragement, and then later I think I gave them money, I forget—  Right, yeah.  
- Q1: Anything else you want to say on that?  
- Marshall: No.  
- Q1: Alright.  
- Marshall: Except that it’s a big, important topic in which the intelligence community has been very slow and resistant to really looking at. Not stuff that we would  do, but the fact that other people may do it, and one of the problems in the intelligence world is how to deal with that. It was one of the good things about Casey,  he understood what the real world was like.  
- Q1: Could you explain the line “Kissinger contrast of Chinese and Soviets” from the  notes for one of your talks on this period?  
- Marshall: Well, I remember when Kissinger came back from the ‘72—I mean the first  big official one that he went with Nixon… He had a meeting at which he briefed  a number of the people on the NSC. Maybe it was only those who had somehow  been involved in assisting the preparations. And I remember I did a few small  things. And he made this point about how good it was to deal with the Chinese,  who were, the way he put it, better than their word, as compared with the Soviets,  who are violating the treaty at the same moment they’re signing it. You know, I  mean [Marshall laughs]. And also what a contrast…Not much…And also intellectually more interesting, better.  
- Q1: Who was the “AF gen” mentioned in the line “Tweedy/Helms reactions/role of  DCI/Intelligence Community staff, AF gen” from the notes for one of your talks on  this period?
- Marshall: It may be a reference to Lew Allen, who was the first head of the Intelligence Community Staff and then later head of NSA. Both Schlesinger and I had  come to know him because he had been involved in the NRO space operations  and so on.92  
- Q1: How much contact did you have with Kissinger before 1969?  
- Marshall: Well, one that I—Well, very slim. I met him…He’d come to RAND…I forget  when it would be, probably the late ‘50s. I remember that he had been invited,  and there was a party for him up at the Wohlstetter’s and I remember being there,  shaking his hand and so on. But he’d also been at RAND, I mean that particular  visit, so I presume that would have been in… probably after this book of his in ‘57  [Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy] so it probably was the ‘58–’59 time period.  But that’s the only two things I can remember. I mean—Right. But I mean I had no  real personal connection with him.  
- Q1: Can you think anything else about this period you’d like to…?  
- Marshall: [Laughs] No, I don’t think so.  
- Q1: I’ve asked enough.

### Endnotes 
1 Eds: This chapter includes four sections. The first two draw on consecutive interviews Guthe  conducted with Marshall in 1993 and 1994—the first covers 1969–1975, and is an interview  from 14 December 1993, the second covers 1973–1976, and is excerpted from an interview  from 8 April 1994. The first outline was prepared for the first interview, while the second outline is an excerpt of the relevant sections from the outline prepared for the second interview.  The third section is an interview conducted on 13 July 1999, and the fourth section is an interview conducted on 20 July 1999. Both cover 1969–1973. Because the third and fourth sections  draw on follow-up interviews and lack the narrative flow of the original interviews, the editors  have chosen to place them at the end of the chapter even though they cover an earlier time period than the second section.

23 This group was called the Consultative Group on War by Accident, Miscalculation or Surprise  Attack. The McCloy arms control study, of which this group was a part, may have been run by  the U.S. Disarmament Administration in the Department of State. An initial search of State  Department records at the National Archives failed to turn up material related to the study. In addition, staff members at the John F. Kennedy Library were unable to find any relevant material in their files.  
24 The group was chaired by Thomas Schelling (Center for International Affairs, Harvard University). The other members were: Helmut Sonnenfeldt (Policy Staff, U.S. Disarmament Administration), Lt. Col. R.A. Boyd, USAF (Plans and Policy, Organization of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff), Marvin Stern (Office of the Director of Research and Engineering, Department of Defense), Brig. Gen. Ariel W. Nielsen, USAF (Plans and Policy, Organization of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff), Henry D. Owen (Policy Planning Council, Department of State), and J.J. Hitchcock  (National Indications Center, Central Intelligence Agency).  
25 Marshall worked on this task with Thomas W. Wolfe, then an Air Force officer at the RAND  Corp. Much of their work involved reviewing and commenting on various material. Rowen  then was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In Nov  1962, OSD/ISA produced a draft paper titled, “Some Lessons from Cuba” (SECRET; Declassified). The paper is reproduced in Laurence Chang and Peter Kornbluth, eds., The Cuban  Missile Crisis: A National Security Archive Reader (New York: The New Press, 1992), 308–318.  Paul Nitze, ASD/ISA at the time, in his memoirs briefly discusses “a postmortem [on the  crisis] prepared in February 1963 by Walt W. Rostow’s Policy Planning Staff in the State  Department and some of [Nitze’s] staff in ISA.” Nitze, with Ann M. Smith and Steven L.

Toward this end, the U.S.  delegation made a statement (Unilateral Statement D) declaring that although “the Soviet  Delegation [had] not been willing to agree on a common definition of a heavy missile…[t]  he United States would consider any ICBM having a volume significantly greater than the  largest light ICBM [then] operational on either side [the SS-11] to be a heavy ICBM.” The  SALT I Interim Agreement (Agreed Statement C and Common Understanding A) required  that “in the process of modernization and replacement the dimensions of land-based ICBM  silo launchers [would] not be significantly increased,” with “significantly increased” defined as  “an increase…greater than 10–15 percent of the present dimensions of land-based ICBM silo  launchers.” Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, Arms Control and Disarmament Agreements: Texts and Histories of the Negotiations (Washington: ACDA, 1990), 173–174, 176. These  limits were ineffective in preventing the replacement of SS-11s by SS-19s. For a discussion of this issue, see Raymond L. Garthoff, Détente and Confrontation: American-Soviet Relations from  Nixon to Reagan, revised edition (Washington: Brookings Institution, 1994), 191–197.  
57 On 10 Aug 1974, President Ford met with Schlesinger, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger,  Assistant for National Security Affairs Brent Scowcroft, and Director of Central Intelligence  William Colby. The purpose of the meeting was to decide whether to go ahead with the Glomar Explorer operation. The ship was in position to retrieve a sunken Golf-class ballistic missile submarine, but was being trailed by a Soviet trawler. U.S. officials were concerned that the  trawler might attempt to stop the unprotected ship from raising the submarine. Ford decided  the operation should proceed. Sections of the submarine were recovered and a “significant  amount of information was retrieved.” Gerald R. Ford, A Time to Heal: The Autobiography of  Gerald R. Ford (New York: Harper & Row Publishers, 1979), 135–136.

62 “When measured according to a definition of defense activities roughly comparable to that  used in the U.S., the Soviet defense effort absorbs some 11–12 percent of Soviet GNP. When  the calculation is based on the broader definition of defense, the share increases to about 12–13  percent.…The new estimate of the share of defense in the Soviet GNP is almost twice as high  as the 6-8 percent previously estimated.” Ibid., 24.

Finney, “Soviet Arms  Outlay May Take a Bigger Share Than CIA Had Estimated,” New York Times, 23 Feb 1976, 13  (mentions Marshall and Schlesinger criticisms of CIA estimates of Soviet defense burden).

90 Marshall confirmed that the study of Soviet perceptions was done by Robert Levine at CIA.  He also confirmed that it was a study of Soviet perceptions of U.S. general-purpose forces.  
91 Marshall agreed that the fact that the 1972 long-term competition report came out so late was  due to the slowness of RAND’s publication process.  
92 Marshall’s interactions with Allen probably occurred while Allen was serving as the first head  of the IC Staff.
