The editors would like to acknowledge the contribution of several organizations  and individuals to the production of this book.  The Smith Richardson Foundation provided the initial funding that supported  Kurt Guthe’s interviews with Andrew Marshall. Guthe also transcribed the interviews,  and as an aid to future researchers and analysts, he also conducted extensive  additional research to identify referenced reports and documents.  The Andrew W. Marshall Foundation and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA)  funded the final editing and publication of the Marshall interviews. IDA also  employed the book’s editors, as well as research analyst Patrick Savage, who converted the Marshall interview transcripts into documents suitable for editing and who  proof-read each document. Barry Watts prepared the initial version of the index.  IDA technical editor Carolyn Leonard conducted the final copy edit, designed and  laid out the text, and prepared it for publication.  And of course, we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge Andrew W. Marshall’s  willingness to undergo many hours of questioning during more than a dozen  interviews spanning six years. His patience, persistence, and strategic thinking  will be sorely missed. This book is an effort to capture some of that thinking for  posterity.
