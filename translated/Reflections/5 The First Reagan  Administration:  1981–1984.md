The election of Ronald Reagan exemplified a shift toward a more muscular  American national security policy toward the Soviet Union.The shift began in the  last year of the Carter Administration with the issuance of Presidential Directive 59  calling for a new “Countervailing Strategy”: if the U.S.couldn’t win a war with the  Soviets, then at least the Soviets would not be able to win either.

[翻譯]
羅納德·里根當選展示了美國對蘇聯更強勁的國家安全政策轉向。這個轉向始於卡特政府的最後一年，當時發布了總統指令59號，呼籲採取新的“抗衡策略”：如果美國不能贏得與蘇聯的戰爭，那麼至少蘇聯也不會贏得。

--- 段落 3 (490 字元) ---
As the directive  stated, “(I)f deterrence fails initially, we must be capable of fighting successfully so  that the adversary would not achieve his war aims and would suffer costs that are  unacceptable…”2  President Reagan took that concept a step further in National Security Decision  Directive 13.“Should nuclear attack nonetheless occur, the United States and its  Allies must prevail,” he believed, not “countervail.”3 Reagan’s theory of the Cold  War was simple: “we win, they lose.

[翻譯]
正如指示所述，“如果威懾措施最初失敗，我們必須能夠成功地戰鬥，以使對手無法實現他的戰爭目標並承受無法接受的代價...”2總統里根在《國家安全決策指令13》中進一步推進了這一概念。他相信，即使核攻擊發生，美國及其盟友必須取得勝利，而不是“對抗”。3 里根對冷戰的理論很簡單：“我們贏，他們輸。”

”4 His administration’s plans for modernizing  strategic nuclear and conventional forces were intended to accomplish that goal.Reagan’s 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative added a new dimension to the competition with the Soviet Union.While brandishing the stick of a military buildup,  however, Reagan also proposed dramatically reducing strategic and intermediate  range nuclear forces, both of which later resulted in arms control treaties with the  Soviet Union.

[翻譯]
他的政府計劃現代化戰略核武器和常規軍隊，旨在實現這一目標。里根在1983年提出的戰略防禦計劃為與蘇聯的競爭增添了新維度。然而，在展示軍備擴張的棍棒時，里根還提議大幅減少戰略和中程核力量，這兩者後來都導致與蘇聯的裁軍條約。

The NATO allies had agreed to a major long-term military modernization program  in 1979 that complemented the U.S.buildup.In 1981, the U.S.Army rolled out the  AirLand Battle concept for fighting and winning a war in Central Europe, and by  1984 it became NATO doctrine as well.For its part, the U.S.Navy signed out a new,  aggressive Maritime Strategy in 1984 intended to persuade the Soviets that, in  the event of war, they would not be able to disrupt easily U.S.

[翻譯]
1979年，北約盟友們同意了一個重要的長期軍事現代化計劃，這與美國的軍事裝備建設相輔相成。1981年，美國陸軍推出了在中歐戰鬥並贏得戰爭的「陸空戰」概念，到了1984年，這一概念也成為了北約的教義。就其部分，1984年，美國海軍發布了一項新積極的海上戰略，旨在說服蘇聯，在戰爭爆發時，他們將無法輕易地打亂美國的戰略。

convoys reinforcing  Europe nor be confident of the survivability of their ballistic missile submarine  force.The Soviets, meanwhile, were bogged down in Afghanistan after their 1979  invasion, and U.S-supplied Stinger missiles to the mujahideen contributed to the  eventual failure and withdrawal of the Red Army ten years later.The aging Soviet  leadership was in turmoil when Leonid Brezhnev died in 1982, Yuri Andropov died  in 1984, and Konstantin Chernenko died in 1985.

[翻譯]
同時，美國也不敢肯定他們的強化歐洲的護航艦隊，也沒有信心他們的彈道導彈潛艇部隊的生存能力。與此同時，蘇聯在1979年入侵阿富汗後陷入泥潭，美國供應給慕加迪斯坦的飛彈對紅軍最終的失敗和撤出做出了貢獻。當列昂尼德·布列日涅夫於1982年去世，尤里·安德羅波夫於1984年去世，康斯坦丁·切爾內克諾於1985年去世時，年事已高的蘇聯領導層陷入混亂。

--- 段落 7 (323 字元) ---
The frequent changes contributed to the weakening Soviet hold on Eastern Europe.Soviet leaders were unable to deal effectively with rising national expectations for increased freedoms, as  exemplified by the 1981 formation of the social labor movement Solidarity in  Poland, which successfully negotiated increasing rights.

[翻譯]
頻繁的變革加劇了蘇聯對東歐的控制力量。蘇聯領導人無法有效應對不斷升高的民族期望，他們要求更多的自由，就像1981年在波蘭成立的社會勞工運動「團結」所展示的那樣，該運動成功地談判增加權利。

--- 段落 8 (456 字元) ---
China during this period continued the economic reform initiatives instituted by  Deng Xiaoping, which called for constrained military spending and greater investment in the economy.In 1979, the United States had recognized the People’s  Republic of China (replacing Taiwan), and economic ties between the two countries  began to grow.Consequently, China did not figure prominently in U.S.defense  planning, although Congressional pressures meant that U.S.

[翻譯]
在這段期間，中國繼續實施鄧小平推行的經濟改革政策，這些政策要求限制軍事開支，增加對經濟的投資。1979年，美國承認中華人民共和國（取代台灣），兩國之間的經濟關係開始增長。因此，中國在美國的國防規劃中並不佔主導地位，儘管國會的壓力意味著美國。

--- 段落 9 (397 字元) ---
arms sales to Taiwan  continued, as well as other less visible means of support.In the Middle East, the Iraqi invasion of Iran in 1980 led to nearly ten years of  war between those two countries, which the U.S.observed carefully but took no  action.Because both Iraq and Iran were hostile to Israel, the lengthy war offered a  respite from conventional threats to the major U.S.ally in the region.

[翻譯]
對台灣的武器銷售持續進行，以及其他較不顯眼的支持方式。在中東地區，1980年伊拉克入侵伊朗導致兩國之間近十年的戰爭，美國對此進行仔細觀察但未採取任何行動。由於伊拉克和伊朗都對以色列持敵對態度，這場長期戰爭為該地區主要的美國盟友提供了一個暫時遠離常規威脅的機會。

--- 段落 10 (447 字元) ---
A 1981 Israeli  air attack destroying Iraq’s nuclear reactor at Osirak pushed any nuclear threats  to Israel from that country much further into the future.Israel’s 1982 invasion of  Lebanon was intended to punish the Syrian-supported Palestinian Liberation  Organization for multiple attacks over the years and push it back from the border;  and while it achieved the immediate, near-term tactical goals, it did not produce a  long-term solution.

[翻譯]
1981年以色列對伊拉克奧西拉克的核反應爐發動空襲，將任何來自該國對以色列的核威脅推遠到更遙遠的未來。以色列在1982年入侵黎巴嫩的目的是懲罰受敘利亞支持的巴勒斯坦解放組織多年來的多次襲擊，並將其從邊境推回；雖然它實現了即時的、短期的戰術目標，但並未帶來長期的解決方案。

## 1981–1984  
- Marshall: I made some notes and they’re organized more along kind of themes or  areas in this period.The first one is this analysis of Soviet weakness.That was one  of the major things I was working on.A second one is the Central Intelligence  Agency’s involvement in net assessment, because there was a period of collaboration with them.Then I thought I’d review several of the assessments that were  written in this period.

[翻譯]
1981年至1984年
- 馬歇爾：我整理了一些筆記，按照主題或範疇組織在這個時期。第一個是關於蘇聯弱點分析。那是我當時主要在研究的一個重要議題。第二個是中央情報局在網絡評估中的參與，因為曾有一段時間與他們合作。然後我想回顧一下在這個時期編寫的幾項評估。

--- 段落 18 (465 字元) ---
Then there was the abortive restart of the Israeli talks that  took place in this period.There’s the start-up of the Defense Policy Board; the start  of Summer Studies [in 1985], and there was an episode of negotiation with the  Israelis over the post-‘82 war data.Another thing to talk about is the gradual change in the orientation of the office,  which was driven, in part, by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger’s kind of  total lack of interest in anything.

[翻譯]
在這段時間中，以色列談判重新啟動未能成功。國防政策委員會成立，1985年夏季學習開始，並與以色列就1982年戰爭後的資料進行談判。另一個要談談的是辦公室取向逐漸改變，部分原因是國防部長卡斯帕·韋恩伯格對任何事情都沒有興趣。

--- 段落 19 (459 字元) ---
There’s one other thing which I hadn’t put down  in my notes, which was an effort to continue with this development of the idea of  strategic planning that was pursued during this time.That’s really, in some ways,  part of the analysis of Soviet weakness.Let me get back to this matter of the analysis of Soviet weakness.When the  Reagan Administration started, it coincided with a growing feeling on my part  that the Soviets really were in a lot of trouble.

[翻譯]
在我的筆記中，有一件事情我沒有寫下來，那就是在這段時間持續發展戰略規劃這個概念的努力。這實際上在某種程度上是蘇聯軟弱分析的一部分。讓我們回到蘇聯軟弱分析這個問題。當里根政府上台時，我開始有種感覺，即蘇聯真的陷入了很大的麻煩。

--- 段落 20 (450 字元) ---
Now, that had started back, in a  small way, in the very late ‘70s, with an increasing sense that Soviet military expenditures were being very much underestimated by the CIA in all kinds of ways.One way was that they were simply leaving out a lot of Soviet activities that were  relevant to their military, but weren’t reflected in army units or people wearing  uniforms and so on.A particular thing that was of that sort was in the whole naval area.

[翻譯]
現在，這在一九七○年代末期就開始以較小規模進行，當時有越來越強烈的感覺，認為中央情報局在各種方式中嚴重低估了蘇聯的軍事支出。其中一種方式是他們簡單地忽略了許多與蘇聯軍事有關但並未反映在陸軍部隊或穿制服的人員等方面的活動。一個這樣的例子是在整個海軍領域中。

--- 段落 21 (470 字元) ---
The Soviet navy  never acquired all of the oilers and other support ships, but the whole merchant  marine was designed to convert in wartime to support functions.Yet none of that  was ever included in any of the CIA estimates.I had written something in ‘74 or ‘75  pointing a lot of this out—they never did anything about it.I don’t know whether  it was in the late ‘70s that I made still one more effort to get them to do something,  and they didn’t do a very good job.

[翻譯]
蘇聯海軍從未擁有所有油輪和其他支援船隻，但整個商船隊被設計為在戰時轉換為支援功能。然而，這一切從未納入任何中央情報局的估計中。我在74或75年寫了一些文章指出了很多這方面的情況-他們從未采取任何行动。我不知道是在70年代後期我又一次努力讓他們採取行動，他們並沒有做得很好。

--- 段落 22 (329 字元) ---
Some ridiculous small addition was added.So  I finally got Charlie Wolf started on some of this, although his part was the other  part of it.It had to do with the cost of empire, which is another part of it.5  
- Q3: You got John Jederlinic, as I recall, to go out and look at some Soviet merchant  ships.- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
有些荒謬的小補充被添加進來了。所以最後我終於讓查理·沃爾夫開始處理其中一些，儘管他負責的是另一部分。這跟帝國的成本有關，也是其中的一部分。你找到約翰·耶德林尼克去查看一些蘇聯貨輪，我記得對吧？ - 馬歇爾：對，沒錯。

--- 段落 23 (484 字元) ---
And there was a Russian naval architect, an emigre—but that  probably was in the early ‘80s—who came and told this story about the design of  the support ships for the fishing fleet.This guy had worked in one of the Leningrad yards, at kind of a design bureau there, and the fishing ministry had come  to them asking for a set of refueling ships to support the worldwide operation of  the fishing fleet.And they’d come up with a preferred design for the ship and the  number of ships.

[翻譯]
有一位俄羅斯海軍建築師，一位移民，大約是在80年代初，他來說了一個關於設計漁業支援船隻的故事。這位先生曾在列寧格勒的一家造船廠工作，在那裡有一個設計局，漁業部向他們提出要求，為支持全球漁業船隊的運營提供一批加油船。他們提出了一個優選船隻的設計和數量。

--- 段落 24 (448 字元) ---
When the fishing fleet people put it through the administrative  mechanism, it ended up in the hands of the Navy, who came back with a counter-proposal in which they doubled the total capacity and came up with three  different ship designs, a mix for the whole thing, and that was the program they  actually went ahead with.6  And you could never get these Agency people to reflect any of that.7 Now, subsequently, all of this looks very plausible.

[翻譯]
當漁業船隊的人將其提交給行政機構時，最終落入海軍手中，他們提出了一個反對意見，將總容量加倍，提出了三種不同的船艦設計，整體混合，並且這正是他們實際執行的方案。而你永遠無法讓這些機構的人反思其中的任何事情。現在，隨後看來，所有這一切都是非常合理的。

--- 段落 25 (466 字元) ---
But the Agency’s performance was absolutely abysmal in all of this.The things that made a big impact on me were, first,  there was this clear underestimate of the defense expenditures and defense-related expenditures.Then, it was only really probably in 1980 or ‘81, ‘82, that it  became increasingly clear to me that the estimates of the Soviet gross national  product were too big, in addition.8 So that the total effect of these two errors was  far more dramatic.

[翻譯]
但在所有這些事情中，機構的表現絕對糟糕。對我產生巨大影響的是，首先，他們明顯低估了國防支出和與國防相關的支出。然後，大概在1980或1981、1982年，我開始漸漸意識到蘇聯國民生產總值的估算也太大了。因此，這兩個錯誤的總效應更加戲劇性。

--- 段落 26 (377 字元) ---
It became credible to begin to think that about 25, 35 percent  of the GNP was really going into the military and military-related things.9  That things were bad in the Soviet Union, I think, came first from Igor Birman, who  appeared in the late ‘70s, and certainly had the view that things were bad.I remember also a few talks with Vladimir Bukovsky, and his views of things.

[翻譯]
開始考慮25％到35％的國內生產總值實際上是被用於軍事和軍事相關事物之中，這變得可信。我認為，關於蘇聯情況不佳的消息最早來自伊戈爾·比爾曼，他在70年代末出現，並確實認為情況不妙。我還記得幾次與弗拉基米爾·布科夫斯基交談，以及他對事物的看法。

--- 段落 27 (454 字元) ---
Then Richard  Pipes [Director of East European and Soviet Affairs for the National Security  Council, 1981–82] brought Vladimir Shlapentokh to my attention, probably in ‘81,  and urged that I support him, and so I did that.Also, about the same time, I had  a meeting with Peter Reddaway [Professor at the London School of Economics],  and he talked about, essentially, the despair, demoralization of the people quite  high up in the Soviet establishment.

[翻譯]
然後，理查德·派普斯（1981年至1982年國家安全委員會東歐和蘇聯事務主任）將弗拉迪米爾·夏拉本托赫介紹給我，大概是在1981年，並敦促我支持他，所以我這樣做了。同樣在那個時候，我與彼得·瑞達威（倫敦政治經濟學院教授）有過一次會議，他談到了蘇聯體制中高層人士的絕望和士氣低落。

--- 段落 28 (478 字元) ---
This was based a lot on a set of interviews  that Reddaway had with the son of a very high-level official.And what it reflected was the conversation around his father’s dinner table among very high-level  officials about the state of things, and a conviction that they were never going to  be able to match the West.They had once thought that they could, but then they  realized they couldn’t.The reasons were, on the one hand, the inadequacy of the  Russians in the population.

[翻譯]
這主要是基於雷達威與一位高級官員的兒子進行的一系列訪談。這些訪談反映出在非常高層官員之間圍繞其父親晚餐桌的談話，討論了情況的現狀，以及他們深信他們永遠無法與西方匹敵。他們曾經認為自己可以做到，但後來他們意識到他們做不到。造成這種情況的原因一方面是俄羅斯人口的不足。

--- 段落 29 (461 字元) ---
The “materiel” they were given couldn’t be compared  to Germans or Swiss or so on.And there was also a sense that the whole system  was nutty, including the people above them.- Q3: Was this the son of Roald Sagdeyev, or was that independent?- Marshall: No, no.I don’t know who it was.No, it was not Sagdeyev’s son.Now,  Shlapentokh told me that when he left Russia, he sold a dacha that he had to  Sagdeyev.And they met at the dacha to close the deal and so on.

[翻譯]
他們所得到的裝備無法與德國人、瑞士人等相比。而且整個系統也讓人覺得荒謬，包括他們上面的人。問題3：這是否是羅爾德·薩格迪耶夫的兒子，還是獨立的人？馬歇爾：不，不。我不知道是誰。不，這不是薩格迪耶夫的兒子。現在，謝拉彭托赫告訴我，當他離開俄羅斯時，他將一座別墅賣給了薩格迪耶夫。他們在別墅見面，完成交易等等。

--- 段落 30 (472 字元) ---
Supposedly, according to Shlapentokh, Sagdeyev said to him—this would have been ‘79—that,  “In the past we could always find resources to meet anything that the U.S.did, but  now [the Soviets] had come to a stage where that was impossible.Any new, really  big challenge would be impossible [to meet].”  
- Q4: This was generally, or as it applies to the military?- Marshall: I don’t know how directly military, but it was just a sense that, “We’re  stretched to the limit.

[翻譯]
據說，根據施拉本托赫所說，薩格代耶夫在’79年跟他說過：“過去我們總是可以找到資源來應對美國所做的任何事情，但現在（蘇聯）已經到達不可能再應對的階段。任何新的真正巨大的挑戰都將不可能應對。”
- 問：這通常是指軍事方面嗎？- 馬歇爾：我不知道跟軍事有多直接相關，但僅僅是一種感覺，即“我們已經到了極限。”

--- 段落 31 (487 字元) ---
We just can’t mount any big programs.”  
- Q4: Were these the key things that influenced you to conclude that the Soviet GNP  was overstated?- Marshall: I guess the thing that convinced me most was, initially, not so much that  I had a good idea that the thing was dramatically smaller, that it was probably overestimated to some degree, but the main thing was that they were just in a lot  of economic trouble, that they were just stretched to the limit and were going to  have trouble.

[翻譯]
我們無法實施任何大型計劃。
- 問題4：這些是影響您得出蘇聯國民生產總值被高估的關鍵因素嗎？- 馬歇爾：我想最讓我信服的是，起初，並不是我有一個很好的想法，該事情被誇大的程度很大，而是主要的事實是，他們在很多經濟上遇到麻煩，他們只是處於極限之下，將會遇到困難。

--- 段落 32 (435 字元) ---
- Q2: Did you have Murray Feshbach looking at some demographic things around  this time, too?- Marshall: That had started earlier.As I’d mentioned in an earlier meeting, the  Feshbach stuff had raised real questions about the whole demographic situation.So when he left the government, I had him do this work on the health area, because  it seemed to me that one of the things that they were clearly underinvesting in  was health care.

[翻譯]
問題2：您在這個時候是否也讓穆雷·費斯巴赫看一些有關人口統計的事情？- 馬歇爾：這已經在之前開始了。正如我在之前的一次會議中提到的，費斯巴赫的事情引發了對整個人口統計情況的真正疑問。因此，當他離開政府時，我讓他在健康領域做這項工作，因為在我看來，他們顯然沒有足夠投資在醫療保健上。

--- 段落 33 (307 字元) ---
And that, therefore, in the longer run, the consequences of that  were going to be so pressing that they would have to begin to invest more, and  that, therefore, that would be a competing requirement for investment on their  part that would compete with the military eventually.So I was interested in that.

[翻譯]
因此，長期來看，這將產生如此迫切的後果，以至於他們將不得不開始投資更多，因此，這將成為他們投資的一個競爭性要求，最終將與軍事競爭。所以我對此很感興趣。

--- 段落 34 (266 字元) ---
I had also started the stuff that Enders Wimbush and the people at RAND were  doing on trying to understand the impact of the changing composition of the  conscription cohort, the fact that rapidly a larger and larger portion would be  coming from the Asian ethnics.

[翻譯]
我也開始進行Enders Wimbush和RAND的人們所做的工作，試圖理解徵兵群體組成變化的影響，事實上，越來越大的部分將來自亞洲族裔。

--- 段落 35 (461 字元) ---
10  The other person, I think, that had a big impact on my beliefs about it all was Jim  Billington, who had started talking in the middle ‘70s about the religious revival  that he saw in Russia, and the decline of the official doctrine’s hold on people.He  also told me of a discussion he’d had with a quite high-level Party official about  conversations that were taking place—again, this probably was around ‘82, ‘83—  about their concern about developments.

[翻譯]
另一倦，我認為對我對這一切信念有很大影響的人是吉姆·比林頓，他在70年代中期就開始談論他在俄羅斯看到的宗教復興，以及官方信仰對人們的控制力量的下降。他還告訴我他曾與一位相當高級的黨官討論，他們討論了當時發生的對話，這可能是在82年或83年左右，對他們對局勢的關注。

--- 段落 36 (498 字元) ---
- Q3: The Soviet GNP wasn’t as big as many thought.In addition, the military was  bigger than usual for the Soviet Union.I remember that you were mentioning this  economist, who sort of in the late ‘50s, early ‘60s was talking about how centrally  planned economies probably are not as good as everybody at the time in the U.S.was cracking them up to be.What was his name?- Marshall: Warren Nutter.- Q3: And you said that he was kind of downgraded…  
- Marshall: “Downgraded?” It’s worse than that.

[翻譯]
Q3：蘇聯的國民生產總值並不像許多人想象的那麼大。此外，蘇聯的軍事力量比平常更大。我記得你提到過這位經濟學家，大概在50年代末、60年代初，他在談論中央計劃經濟可能不像當時美國人想象的那麼好。他叫什麼名字呢？
- Marshall：沃倫·納特（Warren Nutter）。
- Q3：你說他被評價降低了…
- Marshall：「被評價降低」？那情況比那好多了。

--- 段落 37 (417 字元) ---
He was kind of exiled.He could not  get a position at a really major university and ended up at the University of Virginia.And he actually served in the [Defense Department in the] first Nixon Administration as Assistant Secretary for Policy Planning in ISA [International Security  Affairs].He and I were graduate students together at the University of Chicago.In  fact, he was Frank Knight’s last major PhD student.

[翻譯]
他有點像被放逐一般。他無法在一所真正重要的大學找到職位，最終在弗吉尼亞大學任職。事實上，他在尼克松第一屆政府中擔任了國防部國際安全事務計畫助理秘書。他和我一起在芝加哥大學攻讀研究生，事實上，他是弗蘭克·奈特最後一個重要的博士生。

And he was made to seem like a kind of right-wing, conservative nut by these  people, which he definitely was not.As I’ve said on other occasions, I would see it  as a sign of a return to some intellectual health of this field if people could stand  up and say Warren Nutter was right.If you read what he wrote, the tone was more  questioning, Why should we believe that these societies are going over the long  term to grow at a significantly faster rate than market economies?

[翻譯]
他被這些人塑造成一種右翼、保守派的瘋子，但事實上他絕對不是。我曾在其他場合提過，如果人們能夠站出來說華倫·奈特是對的，這將是這個領域思想上健康回歸的一個跡象。如果你讀過他寫的東西，你會發現語氣更多的是提出疑問，為什麼我們要相信這些社會長期以來的增長速度將明顯快於市場經濟？

And he did a  lot of statistical work and so on.11
- Q5: What about somebody like [Friedrich] Hayek in all this?Was he just sort of  ignored through this whole period?- Marshall: He was far less ignored, and I don’t really think of him as having played a  big role.In fact, I’m unaware exactly what he was writing and saying during that  period.- Q3: He was writing more about the political pathologies of the socialist system, The  Road to Serfdom.

[翻譯]
他進行了許多統計工作等等。
- Q5: 在這一切中，像海耶克這樣的人怎麼樣？他只是在整個時期中被忽略了嗎？- 馬歇爾：他遠遠沒有被忽視，我不認為他扮演了重要角色。事實上，我對他在那段時期寫作和談論的內容一無所知。- Q3: 他更多地在寫有關社會主義系統的政治病態，《通往奴役之路》。

--- 段落 40 (330 字元) ---
Was Nutter sort of how you got started on this idea that, well,  this conventional view of the Soviet economy just really isn’t right and it’s worth  talking to lots and lots of people to find out how it might be screwed up?- Marshall: No.I talked with him, but we talked mainly about, I think, the defense  budget underestimates.

[翻譯]
那麼，努特是否是您開始思考這種傳統對蘇聯經濟的觀點實際上並不正確，並值得和許多人交流以找出可能存在的錯誤的起點呢？- 馬歇爾：不是。我和他談過，但我們主要討論的是我認為國防預算的低估。

He’d also spent some time at CIA in, I believe, the middlethrough-late ‘50s [1952–53], and then went away and did this work for the National Bureau of Economic Research on these questions.12 And he published this book  in the late ‘60s, I think [The Strange World of Ivan Ivanov, 1969].13 He’d published a  couple of articles.- Q4: I’m interested if you will talk, take this one notch deeper: Andy 
- Marshall’s sort of  intellectual process.

[翻譯]
他也在中後期的50年代[1952-1953]在CIA待了一段時間，然後離開並為國家經濟研究局進行了這項工作。然後他在晚期60年代出版了這本書，我想是[The Strange World of Ivan Ivanov，1969]。他發表了幾篇文章。Q4：我很感興趣您是否願意深入探討安迪-馬歇爾的思維過程。

--- 段落 42 (476 字元) ---
That is, you seemed, basically, to find individuals, sometimes  outliers, and if they say things which seem to fit in an informational sense with  what might be going on, then you begin to push studies along to try to probe  and investigate.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q4: You also remarked that you let people walk in the office who are conventional,  straight-line and talk stuff that you don’t believe is the case.You say, “Thank you  very much,” and you don’t talk to them anymore.

[翻譯]
換句話說，你似乎基本上是在找個別人，有時是例外，在某種程度上，如果他們說的事情似乎在信息上符合可能正在發生的情況，那麼你就開始推動研究，試圖探查和調查。-馬歇爾: 是的。-Q4: 你還提到，讓那些傳統、直線思維的人進入辦公室，說些你不相信的話。你說：“非常感謝”，然後就不再和他們說話了。

--- 段落 43 (481 字元) ---
So what’s your mechanism for  finding what the hell’s going on in the world?- Q3: What’s the filter?- Marshall: I’m not sure I can articulate it very well.I certainly have had this view, much  like Nutter, that it’s hard to think that the Soviet economy was going to grow that  rapidly over the longer term.Some of that went back, really, to the ‘50s at RAND.Here were all these guys at RAND who were studying the Soviet economy, and I  thought what they did was very unimpressive.

[翻譯]
所以你是如何找出這個世界到底發生了什麼事情的機制呢？- Q3：是什麼濾鏡呢？- 馬歇爾：我不確定我能不能表達得很好。我確實有這樣的觀點，很像奈特，認為蘇聯經濟在長期內很難快速增長。這一些回到了50年代在蘭德公司。在那裡有很多研究蘇聯經濟的人，我覺得他們的做法很不印象。

--- 段落 44 (234 字元) ---
Certainly when Joseph Loftus and  I were doing all that work for Project Sovoy we never could get anything out of  these guys that was of any use, of any sort whatever.And also-this sounds maybe  primitive—but you can do rough checks.

[翻譯]
當約瑟夫·羅夫特斯和我在為索沃伊計劃做所有那些工作時，我們從這些人那裡從來得不到任何有用的東西，無論是什麼性質。也許這聽起來有點原始，但您可以進行初步檢查。

--- 段落 45 (439 字元) ---
Compound rates of growth are just very  impressive over any length of time, and the kind of things that people were saying  about the rates of growth in the Soviet Union didn’t jibe with assumptions you had  to make, crude assumptions, about the relative size of, say, U.S.and Russian GNP  in the ‘40s, early ‘50s.And over time, you just had to get more and more skeptical  that these rates of growth are consistent with other information.

[翻譯]
複合增長率無論在任何時間段內都非常令人印象深刻，而人們對蘇聯增長率所說的話和你所需作出的粗略假設卻並不相符，比如在40年代和50年代初，美國和俄羅斯的國內生產總值（GNP）之間的相對規模。隨著時間的推移，你將變得越來越懷疑這些增長率是否與其他信息一致。

--- 段落 46 (450 字元) ---
Because if they’re  growing at that rate, they are going to be a lot bigger than you perceive them to be.- Q3: Right.Either they had to be very small then or very big now.- Marshall: That’s right.So there was that.I suppose also that by the time some of  the emigres started showing up in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, I’d already lost any confidence in the CIA numbers.Of course, the CIA can’t, as I mentioned in another  connection, be singled out.

[翻譯]
因為如果它們以那種速度增長，它們將比你所認為的要大得多。- Q3：對。要麼它們當時必須非常小，要麼現在非常大。- 馬歇爾：沒錯。所以是這樣的。我想也是到了一些移民在70年代末和80年代初出現的時候，我對CIA的數字已經失去了信心。當然，CIA無法單獨指出，就像我在另一個地方提到的那樣。

--- 段落 47 (475 字元) ---
It was the whole of the American enterprise set up to  study this.Except for a few people who didn’t agree, it was kind of 95 percent of  the effort in this country, in academia and the CIA, was agreed about these things.- Q8: There’s a retrospective paper about the economics profession in the ‘50s, written  by Anne Krueger, who was the chief economist at the World Bank, saying that a  strong, dominant wisdom in the ‘50s was that the Soviets have got it right, basically.

[翻譯]
整個美國企業體系都被建立起來研究這個問題。除了少數不同意的人之外，這個國家裡大約95%的努力，包括學術界和中情局，在這些事情上達成共識。Q8:在50年代，世界銀行首席經濟學家安妮·克魯格（Anne Krueger）撰寫了一篇有關經濟學界的回顧性論文，指出50年代的主要共識是蘇聯基本上是對的。

14 And the so-called “neo-orthodox turn” doesn’t really happen until the ‘70s.- Marshall: That’s right.- Q8: Is Frank Knight known for this?You mentioned that he was at Chicago, he was  one of your professors.Was he for a [indistinct] neo-orthodox economist?- Marshall: Oh yes.- Q8: Did he suffer?- Marshall: No, not at Chicago.- Q8: He already had tenure, he somehow got tenure before…  
- Marshall: He was one of the outstanding people at Chicago and had been there  for a long time.

[翻譯]
14所謂的“新正統轉向”實際上直到70年代才發生。-馬歇爾：是的。-問8：弗蘭克·奈特以此聞名嗎？你提到他在芝加哥，他是你的一位教授。他是否是一位[難以辨認的]新正統經濟學家？-馬歇爾：是的。-問8：他受到了什麼樣的待遇？-馬歇爾：不是在芝加哥。-問8：他已經獲得終身職位了，是在某種情況下在...-馬歇爾：他是芝加哥的傑出人物之一，並且在那裡待了很長時間。

--- 段落 49 (441 字元) ---
And yet he was not a person who was doctrinaire in the way that  Milton Friedman is.He was a much broader person than somebody like Friedman.- Q8: Did he ever visit you here in the Pentagon?- Marshall: No.He was the most prestigious person in the [Chicago] Economics  Department in the late ‘40s, probably throughout the ‘40s.Earlier I was talking about Billington, the story he told me of having dinner with this  high-level Party official.

[翻譯]
然而，他並不像米爾頓·弗里德曼那樣教條主義。他比弗裡德曼更具廣泛性。Q8：他曾經來過五角大樓訪問你嗎？- 馬歇爾：不，他是40年代晚期芝加哥經濟學系中地位最崇高的人物，也許整個40年代都是。早些時候我提到了比靈頓，他告訴我一個有關和一個高層黨官員共进晚餐的故事。

--- 段落 50 (471 字元) ---
According to this source, there was a great argument  going on within the Party about the state of affairs in the Soviet Union.The striking  thing to me, though, was that there was a substantial group of people whose view  was that the only solution to their problem was the restoration of the church.My  feeling was that if there’s a wide group of people in the Communist Party who sees  the solution as being the restoration of the Orthodox Church, they are in trouble.

[翻譯]
根據這個來源，黨內正在進行一場關於蘇聯事務狀況的激烈爭論。然而，我印象最深刻的是，有一個相當大的群體認為他們問題的唯一解決方案是恢復教會。我的感覺是，如果共產黨內有廣泛的人群認為恢復東正教會是解決方案，他們將面臨麻煩。

He  also told me other interesting stories about the private collections of religious art  and so on that high Party people had, and that there was a separate institute run by  some professor and supported by the Party that specialized in the restoration of all  these works of art.So I think—it’s hard to place it exactly—but certainly by ‘82, ‘83, I  was very convinced they were in a lot of trouble.

[翻譯]
他也告訴我其他有關高級黨員私人宗教藝術收藏的有趣故事，還有一個由某位教授負責並得到黨的支持的專門復修這些藝術作品的研究所。所以我認為，雖然難以確切地定位，但到了82年或83年，我非常確信他們遇到了很多麻煩。

--- 段落 52 (471 字元) ---
And I suppose that then there also  was the beginning of the notion that we had seriously overestimated the GNP.Those are two separate issues, in a way, but the stronger was the fact that they  were in very significant economic trouble, and that had a lot of effect on my  thinking about the situation.And so my conviction continued through the ‘80s to  grow on that.So that’s one thing that was going on.Another dimension of this weakness was more specifically military.

[翻譯]
我想當時也開始有人認為我們嚴重高估了國民生產總值。這在某種程度上是兩個不同的問題，但更嚴重的是他們在經濟上遇到了很大的困難，這對我的想法產生了很大影響。所以我對這種看法一直持續到80年代。這就是當時正在發生的事情。這種虛弱的另一方面更具體地表現在軍事方面。

I talked last  time about the stuff that James Roche and I had done on the antisubmarine warfare problem and its effects.One of the first things I did when the new people for  the Reagan Administration came aboard was to talk to Fred Iklé [Under Secretary of Defense for Policy] about this.By that time the Navy was undertaking some  very interesting war-gaming and analysis, all done under Admiral William Small,  who was then the Vice Chief of Naval Operations.Ron St.

[翻譯]
我上次談到詹姆斯·羅奇和我在反潛作戰問題及其影響上所做的工作。當里根政府的新人登台時，我做的第一件事就是跟弗雷德·伊凱（國防部政策次官）談談這個問題。在那個時候，海軍正在進行一些非常有趣的戰爭遊戲和分析，全部由當時的海軍作戰副參謀長威廉·斯莫爾艦長領導。羅恩·聖…

Martin was involved in a number of these things.A special briefing was  arranged for Weinberger to apprise him of this opportunity.All of that, therefore, continued and, in fact, was picked up and reinforced when Admiral James  Watkins became the CNO.15 He picked up on this in a very major way, which I  think, given most people’s view of Watkins, they may be surprised.But he was one  of the most innovative guys in this respect.

[翻譯]
馬丁參與了許多這些事情。為了讓韋恩伯格了解這個機會，特別安排了一次簡報會。因此，所有這一切都持續進行，事實上，當詹姆斯·沃特金斯海軍上將接任美國海軍作戰部長時，這一切被進一步強化。他以非常重要的方式採納了這一切，我認為，考慮到大多數人對沃特金斯的看法，他們可能會感到驚訝。但他在這方面是最具創新力的人之一。

--- 段落 55 (482 字元) ---
And he organized an effort that Bill  Manthorpe was very much involved in, which led to something called the “Blue  Book,” which was a whole set of things that could be done—a deception program  and some other things.So that continued, and through Small I was kept informed  on what the Navy was doing.- Q4: Would you speculate on why, say, the Navy got to this thing faster than, say, the  Army or the Air Force?Was it because, for example, they spend more time among  the Soviets?

[翻譯]
他發起了一項計劃，其中比爾·曼索普非常積極參與，這導致了所謂的“藍書”，這是一整套可以採取的行動計劃-一個欺騙計劃和其他一些事情。這樣持續下去，透過史諾我被保留在海軍所做的事情上。您對為什麼，比如說，海軍比陸軍或空軍更快投入此事，是否有推測？是因為他們花更多時間與蘇聯人相處嗎？

--- 段落 56 (462 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, there was that, and they had a very special intelligence window  into things.Also, it was probably that the kind of diagnosis that Roche and I and  maybe a few others began to see in them, beginning in the middle and late ‘70s,  was convincing for a variety of reasons.And it was such a big shift, and suggested  such high leverage that we had, that it was very compelling to people.There was  nothing quite comparable, I think, in other areas.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，他們擁有一個非常特別的情報窗口。此外，羅奇和我，也許還有其他幾個人開始在70年代中後期看到他們的診斷類型，對於各種原因都很有說服力。這種轉變如此巨大，且有如此高的杠杆作用，對人們來說非常引人入勝。我認為在其他領域中並沒有太多相似的情況。

--- 段落 57 (496 字元) ---
So it represented a really big  shift in beliefs on the part of people once they saw this.Another kind of thing that was going on in this general area of exploiting Soviet  weakness was this return to, or further development of these ideas on long-term  competition.It’s about this time that I started some studies.I had three study efforts on this “cost-imposing strategy.” Chip Pickett did one, George Pugh directed  a set of studies, and Bill Reckmeyer picked up on that.When do you date that?

[翻譯]
因此，人們一旦看到這個，對信念的信念產生了一個非常大的轉變。在利用蘇聯弱點的這一般領域中，另一種事情正在發生，這就是對長期競爭觀念的回歸或進一步發展。大約在這個時候，我開始進行一些研究。我在這個“實施成本策略”上進行了三個研究工作。芯片皮克特進行了一項研究，喬治普夫指導了一系列研究，而比爾雷克邁爾則接手這項工作。你認為這時候是什麼日期？

- Q4: The study was delivered in the summer of 1983, so we started the work in the  winter, January of ‘83.17 And it was very difficult to get people to work on it, to get  people to take the right focus.Getting them to really think about the issues the  way that you were trying to think about them.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q8: Was one of the studies done by Booz-Allen and it said on the cover “Soviet  Vulnerabilities” or something like that?It was in ‘84?

[翻譯]
16
- 問題4：這項研究是在1983年夏天進行的，所以我們在冬季開始了工作，即1983年1月。而找到人來參與工作、讓人們專注在正確的焦點上是非常困難的。讓他們真正思考問題的方式，就像你設想的那樣。- 馬歇爾：對，沒錯。- 問題8：其中一份研究是由博士艾倫公司進行的，封面上寫著“蘇聯的弱點”之類的字句。這是在1984年嗎？

--- 段落 59 (448 字元) ---
Something that I was always  stunned with, your office, whoever, on this whole issue.I can’t remember who  did it.It was either Booz-Allen or BDM.And it was a conference you had hosted  on Soviet vulnerabilities; that was in the title.And there were color tabs for each  topic or vulnerability.- Marshall: Yeah, that was BDM, I think, that did that.- Q8: Same period?‘83?Or ‘84?- Marshall: No, I think all those things happened about the same time.

[翻譯]
我一直對你們辦公室關於這整個問題的舉辦會議感到震驚。我忘記是誰辦的了，可能是布茲艾倫或BDM。會議的主題是蘇聯的弱點；每個主題或弱點都有不同顏色的標籤。- 馬歇爾：對，我想是BDM辦的。- Q8：是同一個時期嗎？‘83年？還是‘84年？- 馬歇爾：不，我想這些事情都差不多是同一段時間發生的。

--- 段落 60 (393 字元) ---
I think probably around ‘82, ‘83, something like that.- Q8: It went beyond imposing costs.It was laying out a blueprint almost of what  could be done.- Marshall: That’s related, really, to one of the things that happened as part of this  start-up of the Defense Policy Board.I’d actually forgotten that had happened,  that BDM thing.- Q2: Was that Phillip Karber?- Marshall: Yeah, he ran that.

[翻譯]
我想大概是在‘82、‘83年左右，大約那個時候。- Q8：這不僅僅是施加成本。它幾乎可以說是在制定一份藍圖，顯示了可以做些什麼。- 馬歇爾：這與防衛政策委員會啟動的一個部分有關。我實際上已經忘記了發生過這樣的事情，那個BDM的事情。- Q2：是菲利普·卡伯嗎？- 馬歇爾：對，他領導了那個。

--- 段落 61 (439 字元) ---
But the most systematic thing, in some respects, is  probably a series of things done by George Pugh, I think.They were the most  elaborated things.18  
- Q2: On cost-imposing?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: And where was he?- Marshall: He ran his own company.- Q2: “DSCA” or one of those?- Marshall: Yes.“DS-something” [DSA—Decision-Science Applications, Inc.]  
- Q2: Did he do that cruise missile one, as a cost-imposing strategy?Did he do that?

[翻譯]
但在某些方面最有系統的可能是由George Pugh進行的一系列事情。我認為那些是最複雜的事情。在成本上施加壓力嗎？-馬歇爾：是的。-Q2：他在哪里？-馬歇爾：他經營著自己的公司。-Q2：「DSCA」或其中一個？-馬歇爾：是的。「DS-something」[DSA-決策科學應用公司]。-Q2：他是以成本施加壓力策略來做那個巡航導彈的嗎？他有做那個嗎？

- Marshall: I think so [Cruise Missile Cost-Imposing Effectiveness: A Case Study of the  Impact of the U.S.Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) on Soviet Air Defense Costs].So there were a series of studies that were done.This began probably in early  ‘82 or something like that, maybe even late ‘81.Some of that was a response to  something that happened in either late ‘81 or early ‘82, and that was the Administration putting together its first defense policy guidance [Defense Guidance].

[翻譯]
Marshall：我想是的[Cruise Missile Cost-Imposing Effectiveness: A Case Study of the Impact of the U.S.Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) on Soviet Air Defense Costs]。那時進行了一系列研究。這可能是從'82年初開始，甚至是'81年底。其中一些是對'81年底或'82年初發生的事情的回應，那是政府制定其第一份防禦政策指導[Defense Guidance]。

I don’t know who Iklé had really write that, but he had me look at it, and asked  whether there was any other thing that ought to be in it.I said, “Well, there is this  idea of exploiting Soviet weaknesses.” And he said, “Oh yes, right.That’s a reasonable idea.So why don’t you write a section?

[翻譯]
我不知道是誰真的寫這個，但他讓我看了一下，問到是否應該加入其他內容。我說：「嗯，有關利用蘇聯的弱點這個想法。」他說：「噢是，對，這是個合理的想法。那你為什麼不寫一個部分呢？」。

--- 段落 64 (438 字元) ---
” So I wrote about two pages that said  we’re engaged in this long-term competition with the Soviets, they have resource  constraints and so on, and, therefore, in your programs that you propose, there  should be a discussion of how this program contributes to or directly exploits  Soviet weaknesses.In particular, there’s this idea of cost-imposing strategies and,  if possible, estimates ought to be made of the costs that are imposed.

[翻譯]
所以我寫了大約兩頁的內容，說明我們正在與蘇聯進行這場長期競爭，他們面臨資源限制等問題，因此，在您提出的計劃中，應討論這個計劃如何有助於或直接利用蘇聯的弱點。特別是有這樣一個成本施加戰略的想法，如果可能的話，應該估算施加的成本。

That was  in there [the guidance] the first time, and then the next time it was largely just  reproduced, but then it began to be negotiated away by the bureaucracy as just  too hard, too difficult, with people essentially saying, “We don’t know how to do  that,” and it gradually became neutered.19 One interesting aspect of that was that  when Frank Carlucci left as Deputy Secretary [of Defense], and was replaced by  this businessman—I forget his name…“Norton” or something like that.

[翻譯]
這一點在最初的指導文件中已經包含在內，然後下一次它主要只是被複製，但後來開始被官僚機構視為太困難、太艱難，人們基本上說，“我們不知道如何做”，逐漸變得無效。其中一個有趣的方面是，當弗蘭克·卡魯奇離開副部長職位時，被這位商人取代-我忘記他的名字了...“諾頓”或類似的。

--- 段落 66 (408 字元) ---
But at any  rate, one of the interesting things was that he happened to read this thing and  said, “That’s a terrific idea!What have people actually done about it?” And he sent  out a memorandum to each of the Services asking them, “What have you done  about this?”20  
- Q3: Thayer, wasn’t it?Thayer.Paul Thayer.- Marshall: Thayer, yeah right.And we got back these ridiculous answers from all the  Services.

[翻譯]
但無論如何，有趣的是他碰巧讀到這個東西，並說：“這是個很棒的主意！人們實際上已經采取了什麼行動？”然後他向每個軍種發出備忘錄詢問他們：“你們對此做了什麼？” - Q3: 塞爾，是不是？塞爾。保羅·塞爾。- 馬歇爾：塞爾，是的。然後我們收到所有軍種的荒謬答案。

--- 段落 67 (470 字元) ---
From the Navy: “We do this all the time,” and a bunch of examples that  were all baloney, and not really reporting on the relevant things that it was really  doing.21 I think the Army never responded, and the Air Force came back with  some feeble set of answers.22  
- Q2: They did this all again when we did competitive strategies.- Marshall: That’s right.Same thing.- Q5: The one that’s particularly puzzling is the Navy, because they actually had something to report.

[翻譯]
從海軍來的資訊：「我們這樣做是很平常的」，列舉了許多都是胡扯的例子，並沒有真正報告有關它真正正在做的相關事項。我想陸軍從未回應，而空軍則給出了一些軟弱的答案。
- Q2：當我們進行競爭策略時，他們又重複這樣做了。- 馬歇爾：沒錯。同樣的情況。- Q5：尤其令人困惑的是海軍，因為他們實際上有一些東西要報告。

--- 段落 68 (392 字元) ---
- Marshall: That’s right, yeah.They didn’t understand it in those terms, whatever.In  fact, I’ve been trying to get a copy of this first DPG [Defense Guidance].One other thing to report on about this general theme and topic is that fairly  early in the Administration, Carlucci asked me to come see him.This was probably  March of ‘82, although it might have been earlier than that [Apr ‘81].

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：沒錯，對。他們當時並不理解這些術語，無論如何。事實上，我一直在試圖獲得這份第一份DPG（防禦指導）。另一個要報告的關於這個主題和話題的是，早在政府任期初期，卡爾魯奇就要求我去見他。這大概是在1982年3月，儘管可能比那個更早（1981年4月）。

--- 段落 69 (499 字元) ---
Anyway, the  Administration was being beaten up a bit in the Congress and elsewhere for not  having a strategy, which in retrospect, is a little crazy.The criticism was that its  defense policy was just a big budget, you know, spend more on everything, and  that there wasn’t any strategy.- Q8: In this case you have to conclude that Congress was correct.- Marshall: Yes, in that respect, probably.And Carlucci wanted to know, what would  people accept as a strategy?What would a strategy really be?

[翻譯]
無論如何，政府在國會和其他地方被批評沒有戰略，事後看來有點瘋狂。批評是說它的國防政策只是一個龐大的預算，你知道的，對所有事情都增加支出，而且根本沒有任何戰略。- 問題8：在這種情況下，你必須得出結論，國會是正確的。- 馬歇爾：是的，在這方面，可能是的。卡魯奇想知道，人們會接受什麼樣的戰略？真正的戰略應該是什麼？

--- 段落 70 (468 字元) ---
And if they ought  have one, what could they do?So I wrote him two memos, which I do have, and  I sent him a lot of the stuff that had been done earlier on strategic planning and  about strategy.And I told him, “This is what a strategy might be and here are  some examples of it.” And I sent him some papers.I remember one thing, a paper  that Roche and I had written for [Secretary of Defense] Donald Rumsfeld that  focused on the Navy.I sent him things of that sort.

[翻譯]
如果他們應該擁有一個策略，他們可以做些什麼呢？所以我寫了兩份備忘錄給他，我還送了給他很多之前關於戰略規劃和策略的資料。我告訴他，“這可能就是一個策略，這裡有一些例子。” 我還給他送了一些文件。我記得有一篇文章，是我和羅切為前國防部長拉姆斯菲爾德寫的，專注於海軍。我送了這些東西給他。

Then I also wrote him a suggestion about how you might go about putting  together some group or process for developing such things.Nothing ever came  of any of that, I mean, the one thing that came of it was the creation of this thing  that Karber headed over at the National Defense University, where…  
- Q2: SCDC, Strategic Concepts Development Center.

[翻譯]
然後我也給他寫了一些建議，關於如何建立一個小組或流程來開發這些東西。然後這些建議從來沒有落實，我的意思是，唯一實現的是Karber在國防大學領導的這個東西的創建，也就是... - Q2: SCDC，Strategic Concepts Development Center.

--- 段落 72 (399 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yeah…where Weinberger kind of added on to something that— I guess,  it was General David Jones [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] who was starting a couple of things over there.One was to look at mobilization, and I forget the  second one, some sort of gaming activity.- Q2: There were three of them.The first one was the Strategic Concepts Development Center that Karber headed up.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：是的...魏因伯格在某種程度上補充了某件事情，我想是特營的戴維·瓊斯將軍（聯合參謀長）在那裡開始了一些事情。其中之一是研究動員，我忘記了第二個，某種遊戲活動。

- Q2：共有三個。第一個是由卡伯領導的戰略概念發展中心。

--- 段落 73 (489 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yeah, but that was the add-on, that was the thing that…  
- Q2: Then the Mobilization Concepts Development Center.- Marshall: Right, right.- Q2: And they had the war-gaming center [Wargaming and Simulation Center].And  then, eventually, those three became the Institute for National Strategic Studies.- Marshall: Yeah, right.But initially, Jones had the two and three of that, and  Weinberger then added this other thing.And that was the whole response to the  strategy notion.

- 馬歇爾：是的，但那是附加的，那是…  
- Q2：然後是行動概念發展中心。- 馬歇爾：對，對。- Q2：然後他們有戰爭遊戲中心[戰爭遊戲和模擬中心]。然後，最後，這些三個合併成國家戰略研究所。- 馬歇爾：是的，對。但一開始，瓊斯有這兩樣，後來溫伯格又添加了另外一樣。這就是對策略概念的整體回應。

Then the way they actually used Karber and company was not to  really focus on these strategic kind of issues at all.The one other thing worth mentioning is that Weinberger totally rejected the  notion of Soviet weakness, despite this book that’s out called Victory [by Peter  Schweizer], which claims that there was this comprehensive strategy, at least for  some members of the Reagan Administration.

[翻譯]
然後，他們實際上使用Karber和他的團隊的方式並不是真正專注於這些戰略性問題。還有一個值得一提的是，韋恩伯格完全拒絕了蘇聯虛弱的概念，儘管有一本名為《勝利》（作者彼得·施韋澤）的書稱，至少對於裡根政府的某些成員來說，存在這種全面的戰略。

--- 段落 75 (465 字元) ---
23 I think in Reagan’s case that might  well be true, in William Casey’s [Director of Central Intelligence] case it might well  be true, but was definitely not, as far as I can tell, true in the case of Weinberger…  
- Q8: Or George Shultz [Secretary of State].- Marshall: …or Shultz, right.- Q2: Did you ever talk to Bob Osgood?Osgood had a Policy Planning staff over there  [at State].He was a former Dean, Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International  Studies.

[翻譯]
我認為在里根的案例中這可能是真的，在威廉·凱西（中央情報局局長）的案例中這也可能是真的，但據我所知，在韋茲伯格的案例中絕對不是真的...
- Q8：或者喬治·舒爾茨（國務卿）- 馬歇爾：...或舒爾茨，對。- Q2：你曾和鮑勃·奧斯古德談過嗎？奧斯古德在那裡有一個政策規劃組，是約翰霍普金斯大學高級國際研究學院的前院長。

--- 段落 76 (482 字元) ---
Initially, Paul Wolfowitz went over there, didn’t he?- Marshall: Paul was over there.- Q2: Alexander Haig [Secretary of State] brought him over.- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: So that was later on when Osgood was over there.But Osgood had this view  about they had these weaknesses and we should try to roll them back, but that  would have been later on in the Reagan years.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q8: Weinberger’s congressional testimony on the Soviet Union frequently used the  word “relentless.

[翻譯]
最初，保羅·沃爾福維茲去那裡了，對吧？- 馬歇爾：保羅曾在那裡。- Q2：亞歷山大·海格[國務卿]帶他去的。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：所以後來奧斯古德在那裡。但奧斯古德有這種看法，認為他們存在著這些弱點，我們應該試著壓制它們，但這應該是在雷根年代後期。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q8：韋恩伯格對蘇聯的國會證詞中經常使用“無情”這個詞。

--- 段落 77 (178 字元) ---
” And there’s no notion of weakness, or vulnerability, or these people are spread too thin.[Indistinct] They were not in the congressional presentations at all.- Marshall: Oh no.

[翻譯]
這裡沒有弱點、脆弱性，或者這些人太過分散的概念。他們根本沒在國會報告中提到。- 馬歇爾：哦不。

--- 段落 78 (364 字元) ---
And I know that a little later on—I think it really would be in the  early part of the second Reagan Administration—we had a briefing to Weinberger of stuff that we had been doing, and he was very much focused on this  underestimate of the Soviet defense expenditures and, therefore, they have  this burden and it’s a problem and so on—which he dismissed entirely.

[翻譯]
我知道稍後一點，也許是在雷根政府第二個任期的早期，我們向韋恩伯格做了一次簡報，關於我們一直在做的事情。他非常關注蘇聯國防支出被低估的問題，因此他們有這個負擔，這是個問題等等，但他完全不理會這一點。

--- 段落 79 (363 字元) ---
He had  various arguments about why it couldn’t be true because their labor costs were so  low and they hardly paid their servicemen anything.So there was no sense there  of any of this.I don’t know the exact timing of that.It might have been at the very  end of this period that we’re talking about, up through the end of ‘84, or it may  have been just after it.

[翻譯]
他有各種理由認為這個說法是不可能的，因為他們的勞動成本低，幾乎沒有支付服務人員任何報酬。所以在這方面毫無意義。我不知道確切的時間。這可能是在我們討論的期間結束時，一直到1984年年底，或者可能是之後不久。

--- 段落 80 (274 字元) ---
On the other hand, early on in the administration, probably late ‘81, early ‘82, I  remember a meeting where there was a substantial delegation of labor leaders  who came, a meeting in the Secretary’s conference room, and Fred Iklé gave a talk,  which was very much of this.

[翻譯]
另一方面，在政府初期，大概是在1981年後期至1982年初期，我記得有一次會議，有一大批工會領袖來了，這是在部長的會議室舉行的，弗雷德·伊克勒發表了一場講話，非常符合這一情況。

--- 段落 81 (496 字元) ---
Not so much stressing their weakness, pointing to that and that they don’t have unlimited resources, but talking about, on the one  hand, we’re building up and it’s going to create demands on them to increase some  of their expenditures to counter what we’re doing; on the other hand, we’re instituting new measures to prevent access to technology, and therefore, it makes it  more costly for them to respond to us and so on.And there was this whole sense  of a strategy that he was articulating.

[翻譯]
不是強調他們的弱點，指出他們並沒有無限的資源，而是談論的是，一方面，我們正在建立，這將要求他們增加一些支出來對抗我們正在做的事情；另一方面，我們正在實施新措施防止技術進入，因此，這使他們對我們做出反應變得更加昂貴等等。整個策略是他在表達的。

--- 段落 82 (489 字元) ---
But most of the time I saw no evidence of it.Although Weinberger was quite enthusiastic about the ASW [Eds: anti-submarine  warfare] things the Navy was doing, and he certainly was not in favor of being  friendly or helpful to the Soviets, and if you could do them in or do something  that caused them a lot of troubles, that was fine.24 But he did not have a sense,  I think, of the economics of the situation very clear in his mind.In fact, very few  people did, as far as I’m concerned.

[翻譯]
但大部分時間我並沒有看到這一點的證據。尽管韋恩伯格對海军所做的反潛戰[註：反潛戰]工作非常熱衷，而且他絕對不支持對蘇聯友好或提供幫助，如果你能對他們造成困擾或做一些讓他們很麻煩的事情，那是可以的。但我認為他並没有對情況的經濟面非常清楚地認識。事實上，就我而言，很少有人明白這一點。

--- 段落 83 (432 字元) ---
The thing that I’m struck by now is the emergence of all these people who supposedly had these views.There’s an increasing  number who saw the light early, I guess.Let’s get on to topic two, the CIA and net assessment.An interesting aspect of this  period was that early on, Casey and Weinberger had a meeting.25 In the Harold  Brown period, the effort of the CIA to get into the net assessment business had  been strongly rebuffed.

[翻譯]
我現在感到震撼的是，越來越多人開始表露出這些觀點。越來越多人似乎很早就看清了真相，我想。讓我們來討論第二個話題，即中央情報局和網絡評估。在這個時期有一個有趣的地方，就是開始時，凱西和韋恩伯格會面了。在哈羅德·布朗時期，中央情報局試圖進入網絡評估業務遭到了強烈的拒絕。

--- 段落 84 (449 字元) ---
26 But this [the Casey-Weinberger meeting] was an attempt  at an agreement to stop the conflict between the CIA and Defense.There was an  agreement laid down that Defense was going to supply more Blue data, and there  were to be these jointly done net assessments, rather than the Agency going  ahead and doing its own.27 Given that Harry Rowen had become the head of the  National Intelligence Council that worked very well.Not very many were done.

[翻譯]
但這次凱西-魏恩伯格的會議是一場旨在達成協議，以停止中央情報局和國防部之間的衝突。雙方達成了一項協議，國防部將提供更多藍方資料，並將進行共同進行的網絡評估，而不是由情報機構單獨進行。考慮到哈里·羅文已成為國家情報委員會的主管，這個安排運作得非常好。這樣的協議並不多見。

--- 段落 85 (450 字元) ---
In fact, only one was really done, which was a really big effort, on the strategic  balance.And that succeeded very well, as I say, because Harry was there and I was  here.Charlie Pease [a Navy Captain in Net Assessment] and Lawrence Gershwin  [National Intelligence Officer for Strategic Forces], who had just gone over there  [to the CIA], got together, and it’s probably the most satisfactory assessment of  the strategic balance that we ever did.

[翻譯]
事實上，只有一項真正完成，這是一個非常大的努力，對戰略平衡的努力。而這項任務非常成功，因為哈利在那裡，而我在這裡。查理·皮斯（一名海軍上校，屬於網絡評估部）和勞倫斯·格什溫（戰略部隊國家情報官員），剛到中央情報局，他們聚在一起，這可能是我們所做的戰略平衡評估中最滿意的一次。

--- 段落 86 (473 字元) ---
We didn’t really do very much after that,  and the ones before were not adequate in lots of ways.Even then, there were  things that couldn’t be in it because they were too classified.So I had a short meeting with Weinberger, and I had a meeting with Iklé, to  remind them that, here was this assessment, which on the whole I thought was  good, but that there were three areas where we hadn’t been able to adequately  account for things that were largely a plus on our side.

[翻譯]
之後我們並沒有做太多事情，之前的那些在很多方面都不夠完善。即便如此，還有一些事情無法包含在內，因為它們屬於高度機密。所以我和韦恩伯格有過一次簡短的會議，也和伊克勒有過一次會議，提醒他們這份評估報告，在整體上我認為還不錯，但有三個方面我們未能充分說明不利於我方的事情。

--- 段落 87 (482 字元) ---
So that the real balance  was probably more favorable than the one expressed in this thing.One of these  was the B-2, that was going to be coming along—stealth; [one was] this ASW  advantage and all the implications it had, the fact that very likely in the early  phases of any conflict, during any conventional phase, we would attrit a lot of the  nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines; and a third thing, which I still don’t  think I can talk about, but which was going on.

[翻譯]
因此，實際的平衡可能比這件事情表達的更有利。其中之一是B-2，即將推出 - 隱身；另一個是這種反潛優勢及其帶來的所有可能性，事實上在任何衝突的早期階段，任何傳統階段，我們很可能會磨損許多核動力彈道導彈潛艇；第三件事，到目前為止我仍覺得不能談論的事情，卻正在進行中。

--- 段落 88 (466 字元) ---
The other kind of balances that were being done in the period included Asia.28  It’s the most comprehensive Asian thing that we’ve done.We haven’t really done  one since then.We’re working our way to maybe do another one.We did a power  projection balance which was pretty good.Early in the period, we finished off this Northern Flank assessment, which reflected some of the stuff that we had done  before.- Q2: Who did these?Who did power projection?Northern Flank?

[翻譯]
在這一時期進行的另一種平衡包括亞洲。這是我們做過最全面的亞洲工作。自那時以來，我們實際上沒有再做過類似的工作。我們正在努力準備可能進行另一項工作。我們進行了一項相當不錯的力量投射平衡。在這段時間的早期，我們完成了這個北緣評估，反映了我們之前做過的一些工作。- 問題二：這些是誰做的？誰進行了力量投射？北緣？

--- 段落 89 (388 字元) ---
- Marshall: The Flank one was done by Jerry Burke.Q2: And who did power projection?Q3: I think Steve Rosen did that.But there was an older Jim Roche Power Projection  Balance that Rosen sort of updated and Dennis Ross “blessed” it.Q8: Who wrote all the parts about how to reorganize the U.S.government to do  better at power projection?It’s in the recommendation section at the end of it.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：側翼部分是傑瑞·伯克完成的。問題2：那個權力投射是誰做的？問題3：我想史蒂夫·羅森做了那個。但有一個更老的吉姆·羅奇權力投射平衡，羅森有點更新，丹尼斯·羅斯“祝福”了它。問題8：誰寫了所有關於如何重新組織美國政府以在權力投射方面做得更好的部分？這些都在建議部分的結尾。

--- 段落 90 (488 字元) ---
Q3: There were parts of it, because we’d talked about how, you know, we didn’t  think about power projection as a separate category.Lots of parts of the American military do that.But Dennis was certainly [indistinct].- Q8: That was a very rich assessment, actually.It ought to have had some impact.- Marshall: Yeah.Well, Dennis…  
- Q3: Well, as I recall, the thing was that some of the earlier projections about Soviet  power projection capabilities having [indistinct].- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
Q3：有部分原因是因為我們談到了我們並沒有將權力投射視為一個獨立的類別。許多美軍的部分做到了這點。但丹尼斯肯定在其中扮演了一定的角色。- Q8：事實上，這是一個非常豐富的評估。這應該會有一些影響。- 馬歇爾：是的。嗯，丹尼斯...- Q3：嗯，我記得，早期有關蘇聯權力投射能力的一些投射已經...- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 91 (428 字元) ---
But Dennis, in the early part, was over with Paul Wolfowitz [at State].He came back in ‘83, ‘84 and became my deputy and then he went away to academia.He returned to the National Security Council staff in ‘86 or something.Then there was the NATO-Warsaw Pact thing at that period that Barry Watts was  involved in.- Q5: Yeah.And Dave Andre got it.John Hines did the Soviet assessment stuff.Eventually Jeff McKitrick inherited it.

[翻譯]
但是，早期的時候丹尼斯和保羅沃爾夫維茨（在國務院）合作。他在1983年到1984年期間回來，成為我的副手，後來離開到學術界。他在1986年左右回到國家安全委員會秘書處。那時正值北約-華沙條約組織的時期，巴里沃茨參與其中。- Q5: 對。然後戴夫安德烈接手了這個事務。約翰海恩斯負責蘇聯評估工作。最後傑夫麥克特里克接手了這個任務。

--- 段落 92 (368 字元) ---
- Marshall: And then there was the investment balance stuff that we were doing, that  David Epstein did.And those are the main things that were going on in that period.But by the end of that time, because Weinberger really wasn’t that interested and  Iklé kept adding other kinds of things for us to do, we began to limit the number  of assessments that we were doing.

[翻譯]
邁爾斯: 然後是我們正在進行的投資平衡工作，是大衛·艾普斯坦完成的。這些是當時正在發生的主要事情。但到了那段時間結束時，因為魏恩伯格並不是那麼感興趣，依克勒繼續添加其他類型的事情讓我們去做，我們開始限制我們所進行的評估數量。

--- 段落 93 (421 字元) ---
And in the second Reagan Administration,  the NATO-Warsaw Pact thing was carried out under Jeff McKitrick, and we continued to look at power projection, but I don’t know that we completed anything.There weren’t too many assessments that were really finished in the second  Administration.- Q2: Probably the Middle East one under Ned Cabaniss.- Marshall: Yeah, right.But we’ll get to that, and the other diversions, later.

[翻譯]
在第二屆雷根政府中，北約-華沙條約事宜是由傑夫·麥基特里克負責，我們繼續關注權力投射，但我不知道我們是否完成了任何事情。在第二屆政府中，真正完成的評估並不多。可能是在内德·卡巴尼斯領導下的中東地區評估成果最多。是的，是這樣。不過我們稍後再來討論這個以及其他偏離話題。

--- 段落 94 (500 字元) ---
Going  back to the beginning of this Administration, there was an attempt to restart the  strategic discussions with Israel.- Q4: Before you switch out of that, what happens to the CIA role in net assessment?Is it just basically on the horizon for a couple of years and then dissipates?- Marshall: We did the one big thing, and then there was an update, I think the year  or so afterwards.Then, they were so resource-demanding on both sides that nobody really wanted to do more.Everybody was so busy.

[翻譯]
回顧本屆政府開始時，曾有嘗試重新啟動與以色列的戰略討論。Q4：在你轉換話題之前，中央情報局在網絡評估中的角色如何？它只是在未來幾年內 大致籌備一番然後消散嗎？馬歇爾：我們做了一次大事，然後經過大約一年後進行了更新。後來，雙方都需要大量資源，沒有人真的想再做更多。每個人都忙得不可開交。

--- 段落 95 (497 字元) ---
So it was there, but  nothing more was ever done.We’ve done a couple of smaller efforts which never  quite came to completion, to do further updating of the strategic assessment, but  it’s just petered out.- Q3: Before we move on here, my memory is that of one of the things which took up  a lot of time and money in the office was the RAND Strategy Assessment Center  effort, and the effort, in general, to improve the modeling capabilities of the  American government with regard to nuclear war.

[翻譯]
所以，雖然我們曾經有這個情況，但從未再進一步採取任何行動。我們曾做過一些較小的努力，但都沒有完成，以進一步更新戰略評估，但最後都沒有進展。在我們繼續之前，我記得辦公室裡花了很多時間和金錢的一件事是蘭德戰略評估中心的努力，以及一般來說，改善美國政府對核戰爭的建模能力。

--- 段落 96 (416 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yes, yes.That’s true, I’d forgotten.- Q3: On which we spent a lot of money, we spent a lot of time.- Marshall: A lot of time, particularly initially.- Q2: We had a whole series of workshops, and walked through the whole thing on  the European model with all kinds of people reviewing those things.- Marshall: Of course, the whole thing had this history.There was this Defense  Science Board study of ‘78.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：是的，是的。沒錯，我忘了。- Q3：在這方面我們花了很多錢，我們花了很多時間。- 馬歇爾：很多時間，尤其是一開始。- Q2：我們有一整系列的研討會，並依照歐洲模式與各種人一起討論。- 馬歇爾：當然，整個事情背後有個歷史。1978年有一個國防科學委員會的研究。

--- 段落 97 (460 字元) ---
And then there was consideration of what to do about  the recommendation to try to develop a more war-gaming style of analysis.It was  all tied, initially, to this sense that our analysis of strategic warfare was…[gap for  tape change]…on missile exchanges and so on.In fact…  
- Q3: It was a strictly economic model for optimum values, which had nothing to do  with the way people would really fight the war.- Marshall: Well, every possible defect imaginable.

[翻譯]
然後考慮如何應對試圖發展更具戰爭遊戲風格分析的建議。最初，這一切都與我們對戰略戰爭的分析有關... [更換錄音帶] ...對導彈交流等互動的分析實際上是...  
- Q3: 這是一種嚴格的經濟模型，其最佳值與人們實際打仗的方式無關。- 馬歇爾：實際上，這可能存在所有可想像的缺陷。

--- 段落 98 (495 字元) ---
If you want to look at an area that is  intellectually awful, it’s that area.It’s as though it got frozen in a middle ‘50s framework or something.It has a whole bunch of problems.Anyway, it’s an area of analysis somebody ought to just go and do a history of and the accumulating defects.So the idea was that a more war-gaming style of analysis would be better.29 First,  it would put this strategic exchange in the context of an ongoing war, which was  probably the way in which it would happen.

[翻譯]
如果你想要看一個智力低劣的領域，那就是這個領域了。就好像它被凝固在五十年代中期的框架中一樣。它有很多問題。無論如何，這是一個需要有人去做歷史研究和累積缺陷的分析領域。所以想法是用更多類似戰爭遊戲的分析方式會更好。首先，它會將這種戰略交流放在一場持續的戰爭的背景中，那可能是發生的方式。

--- 段落 99 (473 字元) ---
So it would be simply a part of a war.With the standard analyses of strategic nuclear war it’s as though you just had taken them [U.S.and Soviet nuclear forces] off to one side and it’s like a weight-lifting  contest or something like that happening on the sidelines of a football game.Then, it had this focus so exclusively on the missile exchange, as contrasted with  the bombers, let alone the submarines, which were simply treated as invulnerable—everybody kept theirs.

[翻譯]
所以這只是戰爭的一部分。對於戰略核戰的標準分析來說，就好像你把它們（美蘇核武器）拿到一邊，就像是在足球比賽邊線上舉行舉重比賽一樣。然後，它將焦點完全放在導彈交換上，而與轟炸機相比，更不用說潛艇了，它們被看作是無敵的——所有人都保留著自己的潛艇。

--- 段落 100 (479 字元) ---
We knew from this other work that some of the submarines might well be sunk.This possibility was never treated, and so the whole  interrelationship of the ASW picture with the strategic balance was never looked  at in any of these models.- Q3: I remember [indistinct] it kind of totally ignored the logic of the Soviet campaign  in the northern area which was designed to increase their submarines’ survival.- Marshall: Yes, right.Then Brown agreed that something should be done.

[翻譯]
從其他工作中我們知道一些潛艇很可能會被擊沉。這種可能性從未被考慮過，因此反潛戰圖像與戰略平衡的整體相互關係從未在這些模型中被研究過。 Q3: 我記得有一個模糊的記憶，它完全忽略了蘇聯在北方地區的戰役邏輯，這個戰役旨在提高他們潛艇的存活能力。- Marshall: 是的，沒錯。然後布朗同意應該採取一些行動。

--- 段落 101 (469 字元) ---
So probably in ‘80 [1979], we  let an initial contract.I think we put out a request for proposals.We got somewhere from five to eight.We winnowed it down to two, and then we gave money to both SAIC and to RAND.30 And we also created a board of people who would  make the decision.After a year’s work, there was a briefing by each one of them,  and a choice was made.And the [indistinct] was very much in full tilt during these  early years of the Reagan Administration.

[翻譯]
所以可能在80年代[1979年]，我們簽訂了一份最初的合同。我想我們發出了提案請求。我們得到了大約五到八個提案。我們將其篩選縮減到兩個，然後我們給了SAIC和RAND各自一些金錢。此外，我們還組建了一個決策委員會。經過一年的努力，每個提案方都進行了簡報，然後做出了選擇。在里根政府初期，這個[不清楚]在進行中。

--- 段落 102 (481 字元) ---
Let me interject one other thing which I have a note on, which I had mentioned.This is something that was kept very quiet at the time, and nothing has been said  about very much since.In, I think it was ‘84, Don Fortier [Senior Director for Policy  Development on the NSC staff] approached Roche and I to talk about something  that the people on the NSC were going to do.The idea was that they wanted to  have a more comprehensive, strategic approach, strategy for the second term.

[翻譯]
讓我插一句另一個我有記錄的事情，這是我之前提到過的。這在當時是非常保密的事情，自那時以來很少有人提及。我記得是在'84年，唐·福蒂爾（國家安全會議政策發展高級主任）找到羅奇和我談談國家安全會議的工作。他們想要在第二個任期中採取更全面、戰略性的方法。

--- 段落 103 (489 字元) ---
31  He came and talked with Jim and me.So Jim and I wrote a paper for him and sent  it over.I don’t know whether Rosen [was working for Fortier at the time] saw it?The paper was very much along this line of exploiting our advantages and their  weaknesses.I have a copy of it someplace [“Stressing Soviet Defense Planning”].- Q3: And there was finally a meeting with you and Admiral John Poindexter [deputy  to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]?- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
31 他來找我們吉姆和我聊天。所以，吉姆和我為他寫了一篇論文，然後寄給他。我不知道羅森（當時是否在為福提爾工作）有沒有看到？這篇論文在很大程度上是利用我們的優勢和他們的弱點。我有一份副本（“強調蘇聯的國防規劃”）。-問：最後你和約翰·波因德斯特上將（總統國家安全事務助理的副手）見了面嗎？-馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 104 (499 字元) ---
- Q3: You, Jim, Don, Poindexter, and Rosen, as I recall.- Marshall: Yes, right.Robert McFarlane [Assistant to the President for National  Security Affairs] was also at this…  
- Q3: Maybe there was another meeting with McFarlane?- Marshall: [Indistinct] meeting with McFarlane.Which took place, I don’t know, early  in, probably, ‘85.- Q2: And what came out of that?- Marshall: Nothing.I guess Fortier had asked other people for advice as well.I think  Albert Wohlstetter wrote something, or did he?

[翻譯]
- Q3：我記得有你、吉姆、唐、波因德斯特和羅森。  
- 馬歇爾：是的，對的。羅伯特·麥克法蘭（總統國家安全事務助理）也在這個…  
- Q3：也許有另一次與麥克法蘭的會議嗎？  
- 馬歇爾：我不太清楚和麥克法蘭的會議。大概是在‘85年初舉行的。  
- Q2：那次會議的結果是什麼？  
- 馬歇爾：沒有結果。我想福提爾也向其他人尋求過建議。我記得艾伯特·沃爾斯泰特寫了些東西，或者他這樣做了嗎？

--- 段落 105 (293 字元) ---
- Q3: Yeah.Bill Odom.Sam Huntington.32  
- Marshall: Right.- Q3: Good idea, but nothing happened 33  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: When did Fortier pass away?- Q3: Summer of ‘86, August of ‘86.- Q2: Was that a reason nothing happened, or was it dead before that?- Q3: It was dead before that.

[翻譯]
Q3：對，比爾·奧多姆。山姆·亨廷頓。32歲。  
馬歇爾：對。  
Q3：這是個好主意，但什麼事情也沒發生。  
馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。  
Q2：富爾捷爾什麼時候去世的？  
Q3：1986年夏天，1986年8月。  
Q2：是這個原因導致沒有事情發生，還是在那之前就已經熄滅？  
Q3：在那之前就已經熄滅了。

--- 段落 106 (388 字元) ---
As I recall, in the meeting with Poindexter, Jim Roche  finished, after all the presentation had been made, and all the steps that had been  prepared [indistinct], Jim turns to Poindexter and says, “John, we’ve brought you  [some ideas].You’ve gotta do something now.”  
- Q2: Was Phil Dur up there, too?- Q3: Part of the time.He left the summer of ‘84 to go off to Lebanon for something.

[翻譯]
回憶起來，在與波因德克斯特的會議中，吉姆·羅奇在所有演示都完成並準備好所有步驟之後，轉向波因德克斯特說：“約翰，我們給你帶了一些想法。現在你必須採取行動。”
- Q2: 菲爾·杜爾也在那裡嗎？
- Q3: 有部分時間在場。他於1984年夏天離開去黎巴嫩做些事情。

--- 段落 107 (442 字元) ---
- Q8: The context of this debate, I should add, in ‘85 was the so-called “Reagan Doctrine” had been announced by the press.But the NSC staff, and State, and Defense  were denying that there was a Reagan Doctrine.And part of it was coming from  Don Fortier himself, who sympathized with some aspects of it, but I guess McFarlane and others kept saying, “Well, there’s not enough consistency among these  different issues to call it a doctrine.

[翻譯]
Q8：我應該補充一下，這場辯論的背景是，1985年所謂的“雷根主義”已經被新聞界公佈。但是，國家安全會議(NSC)的工作人員、國務院和國防部都否認有雷根主義的存在。其中一部分否認來自唐·福特(Don Fortier)本人，他對其中一些方面表示理解，但我猜麥克法倫和其他人不斷說，“這些不同議題之間還不足以形成一個主義的一貫性。”

--- 段落 108 (410 字元) ---
” And so… I notice even now in memoirs about  the Reagan Administration, people on one side want there to have been a Reagan  Doctrine, but others say there never was.- Q3: It turned out that we didn’t have a National Security Decision Directive on  Afghanistan.So we decided to write one.34 Essentially [it said], we should have a  cost-imposing strategy for our activities against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

[翻譯]
因此...我現在在有關里根政府的回憶錄中注意到，有人一方面希望里根有一個主義，但其他人說從來沒有。- 問題3：結果證明，我們在阿富汗並沒有一個全國安全決策指令。因此我們決定撰寫一個。本質上是，我們應該對我們在阿富汗對抗蘇聯的活動擁有一個施加成本的策略。

--- 段落 109 (464 字元) ---
And  in order to do that, we had to be able to measure how the Soviets assessed their  own costs in Afghanistan, figure out what kind of losses in Afghanistan meant the  most to them, and then skew our effort to driving up their indices or their measures of the costs that they were suffering.We might be measuring it all wrong.They might not care about infantry casualties.They might care about officer casualties, or they might care about technology compromises.

為了做到這一點，我們必須能夠衡量蘇聯在阿富汗的成本評估，弄清楚在阿富汗造成的何種損失對他們最重要，然後調整我們的努力以提高他們所受到的成本指標或成本評估。也許我們一直在用錯的方式來衡量。他們可能不在意步兵傷亡，而可能關心軍官傷亡，或者他們可能在意技術上的妥協。

And that was written  into the NSDD and that became part of— That’s the only example—  
- Q8: The whole topic of Afghanistan… It’s not clear how much you [Marshall] were  personally involved in it, but lots of the work became very operational nitty-gritty  stuff, both [indistinct] Steve Rosen and Michael Pillsbury, and others had copies  of things you had produced and were using them in the persuasive part of it.

[翻譯]
這些都被寫入了NSDD中，成為其中的一部分。這是唯一的例子。整個阿富汗議題...不清楚你（馬歇爾）在其中有多少個人參與，但許多工作變得非常具體和實際，包括史蒂夫·羅森和邁克爾·皮爾斯伯里，以及其他人擁有你製作的文件副本，並在說服部分中使用它們。

--- 段落 111 (487 字元) ---
And  the opposition was just enormous, not only to the NSDD framework, but later on  to what could or should be done.And it got into the whole issue of how strong is  the Soviet Union.And there was a “fear” on the part of every single member of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, that if you provoke these guys—  
- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q8: —they’re going to invade Pakistan, and we cannot defend Pakistan under any  circumstances, so it’s just foolish for you to be toying with this monster.

[翻譯]
反對派勢力是巨大的，不僅反對NSDD框架，後來對於可以或應該採取的行動也是如此。這進入了蘇聯有多強的整個問題。每一位聯合參謀總長都有一種「恐懼」，他們擔心如果惹怒這些人——  
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q8： —  他們會入侵巴基斯坦，我們無論在任何情況下都無法保護巴基斯坦，所以你耍弄這個怪物是愚蠢的。

--- 段落 112 (500 字元) ---
There  would be images like this created in the meetings—“Toying with the monster,”  and things like that.The whole notion of weakness was not…  
- Q3: And the flip side would be that there were people that just had these two contradictory notions at the same time.First of all, you would so hurt them that they  would go mad and nuke you.On the other hand, they were so strong that there  was no way that you could hurt them enough in Afghanistan to stop them from  doing whatever they wanted to do.

[翻譯]
在會議上會出現這樣的圖像 - “戲弄怪物”，像這樣的事情。整個弱點的概念並非...
- Q3：而另一面是有些人同時擁有這兩個矛盾的概念。首先，你會傷害他們到瘋狂並且使用核武器攻擊你。另一方面，他們又如此堅強，以至於在阿富汗無論你如何傷害他們，都無法阻止他們做任何想做的事情。

--- 段落 113 (443 字元) ---
So it was both…  
- Q8: This was coming out of Robert Gates’s [Deputy Director for Intelligence] office,  too.The DI under Gates, remember, had a big Afghan task force.They were  writing these papers that they would give to us at meetings, along the lines that,  “nothing you could do—”  
- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q8: —will do any more than cause the death of a few more mujahedin.Our heroes  will die if you do anything more.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
所以同時……
- Q8: 這也是出自羅伯特蓋茨的辦公室，副情報局長。要記得，蓋茨領導下的情報局有一個龐大的阿富汗特遣部隊。他們正在寫這些文件，我們在會議上收到，意思是，“無論你做什麼——”
- 馬歇爾：對，就是這樣。- Q8: —只會造成更多穆賈阿頓的死亡。如果你做得更多，我們的英雄們會死。- 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 114 (454 字元) ---
- Q8: So the thinking about Soviet strategy was…  
- Marshall: Well, right.I should preempt something that we can talk about at the  next meeting.I remember when the competitive strategies thing came out I had  a discussion with the then-head of the Air Force [General Lew Allen], who I knew,  and his argument was, “Well, yes, this is a good idea in a way, but, first, whatever  we do, the Soviets will match us.” [But] there’s no sense in his argument.

[翻譯]
- Q8：所以對蘇聯戰略的想法是…  
- 馬歇爾：對，我應該在下次會議時先提一件事情，我記得當競爭策略出來時，我和當時的空軍司令[艾倫將軍]討論過，他認為，“是的，在某種程度上這是個好主意，但是，無論我們做什麼，蘇聯都會反擊。”[但]他的論點沒有意義。

--- 段落 115 (407 字元) ---
The Soviets have resource constraints; there was not just an infinite supply of resources  available to them.And [his] second thing was, “We’re so inconsistent that if we  start something we’ll weaken and fall off, and they’ll keep going, and then we’ll  be in worse shape than if you’d never done anything.”  
- Q8: Does he [Eds: Guthe] have a research assistant or someone who can dig up a  lot of quotes?

[翻譯]
蘇聯面臨資源限制；他們並不擁有無盡的資源供應。第二個問題是，“我們如此不一致，如果我們開始某件事情，我們會變弱並失去競爭力，而他們會不斷前進，最終我們會處於比從來沒有做過更糟的狀況中。”

問8：他（Guthe）有研究助理或者可以搜集很多引用的人嗎？

--- 段落 116 (450 字元) ---
Because these were… I’ve noticed in the memoir literature now,  everyone is simply ignoring the quotes of the mid-‘80s about the power of the  Soviet juggernaut, not by any professors, but by heads of the Air Force, Army,  Navy, Weinberger himself.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q8: And it’s just being laughed away now: “Oh, we never thought that.We always  knew we were just three years away from the Berlin Wall being cracked open.”  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
因為這些…我現在在回憶錄文獻中已經注意到，每個人都在簡單地忽略了80年代中期關於蘇聯巨人力量的引用，這不是來自任何教授，而是來自空軍、陸軍、海軍以及魏恩伯格本人的主管。-馬歇爾：是的。-Q8: 現在這些話被嘲笑了，“哦，我們從來沒有想過那個。我們一直知道柏林圍牆只是三年遠。”-馬歇爾：對，對。

--- 段落 117 (451 字元) ---
- Q3: The only other thing on the Reagan Doctrine, was, following on from Andy’s  studies of Soviet power projection, Fortier ,was saying, “OK, how can we drive up  Soviet costs of power projection?” Because they were active in Angola, and doing  all that other stuff.And I recall {…}  
- Q8: Are you going to do different assessments at different times [during this project]?Because relevant to this, also, is the ADCAP [advanced capability] torpedo.

[翻譯]
Q3：里根主義的唯一另一個事情是，在安迪對蘇聯力量投射的研究之後，Fortier 表示，“好，我們如何能夠增加蘇聯的力量投射成本？”因為他們在安哥拉活躍，並且做著其他所有的事情。我記得{...}  
Q8：在這個項目期間，您會在不同的時間點進行不同的評估嗎？因為與此相關的還有 ADCAP [高級能力]魚雷。

--- 段落 118 (216 字元) ---
The whole issue of Weinberger and strategy, in some sense, came down at one  point to one of your…I think it was the Navy balance, wasn’t it?I remember reading it from… It was an official balance…  
- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
韋恩伯格和戰略的整個問題，在某種程度上，最終歸結為你的一個…我記得是海軍平衡，對吧？我記得是從…一個官方平衡中讀到的…
- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 119 (521 字元) ---
- Q8: You’re leaving out the effort you made, you had to get Will Taft [Deputy Secretary  of Defense] to…Taft said, “Why don’t you…”—it was Dennis Ross’s idea, actually—  ”Why don’t you get together every single formal assessment Marshall has done,  put all the recommendations together, and check which ones have been implemented and which ones haven’t, and then report to Fred Iklé, [Undersecretary of  Defense for Policy] and Taft about what more needs to be done, and I, Will Taft,  will sort of oversee this process.

[翻譯]
問題8: 你忽略了你所做出的努力，你必須找到威爾·塔夫特（國防副部長）……塔夫特說：“為什麼不……”—事實上這是丹尼斯·羅斯的想法—“為什麼不把馬歇爾完成的每一份正式評估都放在一起，匯總所有建議，並檢查哪些已經實施了，哪些沒有，然後向佛雷德·艾克勒（國防部政策副部長）和塔夫特匯報還需要做什麼，我，威爾·塔夫特，將監督這個過程。

--- 段落 120 (433 字元) ---
” And Marshall drafted one of those memorandums to all Services, everybody in the Pentagon, describing this.Then he gave  it to Fred And remember Fred?“No!”—he didn’t want to do that.But we started  doing it anyway, informally, to see what had been done.And one of the most vivid things was your Naval Balance, said, at the very, very  end, it had like 12, a certain number of recommendations, and one of them was  the ADCAP torpedo.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾起草了一份備忘錄，發送給五角大樓的所有部門和人員，描述了這一情況。然後他將它交給了弗雷德，還記得弗雷德嗎？他不想這樣做。但我們還是開始以非正式方式進行，看看已經完成了什麼。其中最令人印象深刻的是海軍平衡，說了一番，最後有12個建議，其中之一就是ADCAP魚雷。

--- 段落 121 (387 字元) ---
That for reinforcements to NATO, if you can get the probability-of-kill way up against Soviet submarines that were going to otherwise choke off  U.S.supplies—  
- Marshall: Yeah, yeah.- Q8: —it made a big difference in whether or not Europe survived long enough to  continue resupply.And all of a sudden the ADCAP torpedo, which had a Pk [probability of kill] [that] was very, very high.

[翻譯]
就加強北約的增援而言，如果能提高對蘇聯潛艇的殺傷機率，否則它們將封鎖美國的補給——馬歇爾：是的，是的。Q8：——這對歐洲是否能夠倖存足夠持續補給至關重要。突然之間，ADCAP魚雷的殺傷機率非常非常高。

--- 段落 122 (496 字元) ---
You know, most torpedoes were considerably lower…Well, the Senate Armed Services Committee staff had put the ADCAP  torpedo as— They’d zeroed it out that year, because there was testimony from  Litton that it wasn’t ready yet or something like that.And here was a concrete  example of where you’d think the Secretary of Defense would have said, “NATO,  Europe—they’re important.This is a strategy against a known Soviet strategy  to sink our resupply effort.This is very much needed.It’s crucial.

[翻譯]
你知道，大部分魚雷的價格要低得多......嗯，參議院武裝服務委員會的工作人員已將ADCAP魚雷列為零支出，因為根據利頓公司的證詞，該魚雷可能還沒完全準備好之類的。這就是一個具體的例子，你會認為國防部長應該說：“北約、歐洲——他們很重要。這是對抗已知蘇聯戰略的策略，要沉沒我們的補給行動。這很重要，至關重要。

--- 段落 123 (402 字元) ---
” When asked,  [“Has] Weinberger or anybody, even the Navy, singled out the ADCAP torpedo?”  [the SASC staff] said, “No, there’s not even any testimony.” It was just buried away  in the munitions request from the Navy.So that got plussed up, once it was  explained what the importance of it was.But that was an example of what would  have happened if Taft had gone through with the—  
- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
當問及「韋恩伯格或任何人，包括海軍，是否單獨挑出了ADCAP魚雷？」時，SASC的工作人員表示：「沒有，甚至沒有任何證詞。」它只是被埋藏在海軍的軍火請求中。因此，一旦解釋了其重要性，它就被提高了。但這是如果泰夫繼續進行的情況的一個例子—
- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 124 (475 字元) ---
- Q8: —[indistinct] what he thought was right, and said, “No, I really think Andy  Marshall’s recommendations ought to be inventoried and we should see what’s  been done and what’s not been done.” This little anecdote, are you going to have  a session on this?Because this went into “Reagan II,” later on.Your operating environment, here in the Building.- Marshall: Yeah.Well, we can try to talk about some of these things.- Q2: I think on that one I agree, with Fred [Iklé].

[翻譯]
問8: -[不清楚]他認為是正確的，並說：“不，我真的認為安迪·馬歇爾的建議應該被盤點，我們應該看看做了什麼，沒做什麼。”這個小軼事，你們會舉行一個討論會嗎？因為後來這個進入了“裡根II”的內容。您的營運環境，就在這個大樓裡。
- 馬歇爾：是的。我們可以試著談談這些事情。
- 問2：我認為在這一點上我同意費德[Iklé]的看法。

--- 段落 125 (387 字元) ---
Marshall: On the whole, we haven’t been in the recommending business.We’ve sort  of….- Q2: Diagnosis.- Q8: [Indistinct] your recommendations in some of these.- Marshall: Yeah, there are.- Q8: Your name could be stenciled on every ADCAP torpedo.The chairman at Litton  should be in here thanking you.- Marshall: I see.Yes, right, right.Let me get back to the restart of the Israeli talks.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：總的來說，我們不是在推薦業務中。我們有點... - Q2：診斷。 - Q8：[不清楚]你在一些方面的建議。 - 馬歇爾：是的，有的。- Q8：你的名字可以被刻在每一枚ADCAP魚雷上。立頓的主席應該在這裡感謝你。- 馬歇爾：我明白了。是的，對，對。讓我回到以色列談判的重新開始。

--- 段落 126 (436 字元) ---
When Richard Perle [Assistant  Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy] and Iklé came on board  and—Perle in particular knew about the fact that we’d had those earlier discussions  with the Israelis—asked about them, I told him about their demise in the last year of  the Carter Administration.Perle and Iklé wanted to restart them.So I went over to  Israel to make arrangements and talk to them about starting the talks.

[翻譯]
當理察·珀爾（國防部國際安全政策助理部長）和伊克勒（Iklé）加入，特別是珀爾知道我們之前與以色列人進行過討論時，詢問這些討論時，我告訴他們在卡特政府最後一年的時候已經結束了。珀爾和伊克勒想要重新啟動這些討論。因此我前往以色列安排並與他們談論重新開始這些談判。

--- 段落 127 (336 字元) ---
But then the  thing got squashed by Weinberger, because a few days after I left Israel, the Israelis  attacked [on 7 Jun 1981] the Iraqi [Osirak] nuclear reactor.Then later, I talked with  Bud McFarlane, who I guess during the first year or so of the Reagan Administration was an ambassador-at-large [Counselor] in the State Department.

[翻譯]
但後來這事被魏恩伯格壓下，因為我離開以色列幾天後，以色列攻擊了（1981年6月7日）伊拉克奧西拉克核反應爐。後來我與巴德·麥克法蘭( Bud McFarlane)談過，我猜在里根政府第一年左右，他是國務院的特使（顧問）。

--- 段落 128 (400 字元) ---
And it was then  they were transiting to this new form of these talks with the Israelis, in which State  and, really, the Joint Staff, I think, were the main participants, because it was the  direction which the Israelis wanted to go, in any case, of having these talks as real  planning sessions and so on about various things.35  A next thing to talk about is the start of the Defense Policy Board.

[翻譯]
就在那時，他們正轉向這種新形式的與以色列人的談判，國家和聯合參謀部真的是主要的參與者，因為以色列人想要朝這個方向發展，無論如何，都想要進行這些真正的規劃會議，談論各種事情。接下來要談論的是國防政策委員會的啟動。

--- 段落 129 (440 字元) ---
I guess fairly  soon after Iklé was on board, Sy Weiss went to him with the idea of establishing  a Defense Policy Board modeled after the CNO Executive Panel.Fred decided to  go ahead with it, or to do an experiment with it.And there was a period when, in  some way, we probably were breaking the law by having these meetings and it  wasn’t fully established, all the procedures hadn’t been gone through.- Q2: I’m sure no laws were broken.

[翻譯]
我猜在伊克勒上任不久之後，魏斯對他提出建立一個模仿CNO執行小組的國防政策委員會的想法。弗雷德決定繼續進行，或者對此進行一次實驗。有段時間，我們可能以某種方式違反了法律，因為這些會議還沒有完全成立，所有程序還沒有通過。- Q2: 我確定沒有違法。

--- 段落 130 (492 字元) ---
- Marshall: In any case, it was run out of my office at this point.I think it probably  started in ‘83.- Q3: I think it was earlier, ‘82.- Marshall: It might have been.I suppose so, I don’t know.The reason I place it in  ‘83 is that I had the impression that from the beginning Harry Rowen had been a  member of it, and he spent the first two years of ‘81 and ‘82 out at the …  
- Q2: National Intelligence Council [NIC].- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: He came over while he was still head of the NIC.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：無論如何，到這個時候，這個事務是在我的辦公室進行的。我想這可能是從'83年開始的。- Q3：我覺得可能更早，是'82年吧。- 馬歇爾：可能是。我想是吧，我不確定。我把它放在'83年的原因是，我印象中哈里·羅文從一開始就是其中的一員，他在'81年和'82年的頭兩年都在...- Q2：國家情報委員會[NIC]。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3：他還在擔任NIC主席時加入了這個。

--- 段落 131 (491 字元) ---
And Paul Wolfowitz was part of  it when he was still at Policy Planning in the State Department.- Marshall: Yeah.One of the topics early on was another dimension of the Soviet  weakness theme that began to be explored, particularly the possibility that in  Europe, that the Warsaw Pact might have some serious internal problems.And  retired General John Vogt was hired to do a study and exploration of that.- Q2: Is this the one that was locked up, the Vogt study—  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
保羅·沃爾福維茨在仍在國務院政策規劃部門時就參與其中。- 馬歇爾：對，早期討論的一個話題是探討蘇聯的另一個脆弱方面，特別是探討華沙條約組織可能存在嚴重的內部問題的可能性。退役將軍約翰·沃格特被聘請進行研究和探究。- Q2：這是被封存的那份沃格特研究嗎？- 馬歇爾：對，就是這份。

--- 段落 132 (482 字元) ---
- Q2: —was locked up.And all the copies collected.- Q3: Rosen also wrote a paper for you on the character of mutinies in the Warsaw  Pact that might be induced.36  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: No one was allowed to take any copies of that paper anywhere, either.- Marshall: Right.There must be some copies of the Vogt study around here yet, I  don’t know.- Q2: Who was it that was really against the Vogt study?Was that Weinberger?- Marshall: No, I don’t think Weinberger was against it.

[翻譯]
Q2: 那個人——被關起來了。所有副本都被收集起來了。- Q3: 羅森也為您撰寫了一篇關於華沙條約組織叛變性質的文章，可能會引起變化。36
- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3: 任何人都不被允許將該論文的任何副本隨身攜帶。- 馬歇爾：是的。這裡應該還有一些沃特研究的副本，我不太清楚。- Q2: 到底是誰真正反對沃特研究的？是韋恩伯格嗎？- 馬歇爾：不，我不認為韋恩伯格反對它。

--- 段落 133 (465 字元) ---
I don’t know where he really  was [on that] [indistinct].- Q2: There was a lot of opposition to that study.I mean, it was like don’t…Somebody  said this study is not to be circulated 
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: But then SCDC went and sort of tried to replicate a similar kind of analysis about  how to get the East European nations to defect in time of war.I remember being  sent over to listen to their brief.- Q2: A Jeff Simon study?- Q3: I can’t remember who did it.

[翻譯]
我不知道他真正是在哪裡。- Q2：對那項研究有很多反對意見。我的意思是，好像是不要……有人說這項研究不能公開。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3：但後來SCDC去嘗試複製一種相似的分析，關於如何在戰爭時使東歐國家投降。我記得被派去聽他們的簡報。- Q2：傑夫·西蒙的研究嗎？- Q3：我忘記是誰做的。

--- 段落 134 (368 字元) ---
- Q2: But I remember the Vogt study.It was classified TS, and when I came here, I  think you said, “Read the Vogt study.” And there’s only one copy, and it’s locked  in a vault, and all the rest have been destroyed.It was the only copy left of the  study, which also was supposed to have been destroyed, too, but wasn’t.Do you  remember who was opposed to that or why?

[翻譯]
Q2: 但我記得沃特的研究。它被歸類為機密，當我來到這裡時，我想你說過，“讀一讀沃特的研究。” 但只有一份拷貝，它被鎖在保險庫裡，其他所有的都被銷毀了。這是該研究僅剩的一份拷貝，理應也應當被銷毀，但事實上並未被銷毀。你記得是誰反對那樣做的嗎，或是為什麼反對嗎？

--- 段落 135 (407 字元) ---
- Marshall: I know that Vogt went and talked with General John Vessey [Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff] and some of these other people about it and got some response.It was a very mixed reaction, no doubt about that.And there was some discussion  with Bill Casey [Director, CIA] about intelligence activities, operations that might  have to be taken.And again, there was no enthusiasm for doing that.

[翻譯]
Marshall：我知道沃特去和聯合參謀總長約翰·維西將軍以及其他人討論了這件事情，並得到了一些回應。反應是非常混合的，毫無疑問。與中央情報局局長比爾·凱西討論了情報活動和可能需要採取的行動，但再次，對此並沒有熱情。

--- 段落 136 (478 字元) ---
I mean Casey  probably was interested, but the establishment as a whole was rather uninterested.Another thing to mention from this period is that probably the first of the Summer  Studies was done, during, I think, ‘84.- Q4: Wait a minute.Before you get out of [indistinct] the Policy Board.Are you going  to come back to the Defense Policy Board in the subsequent discussions and talk  about how it has grown and changed, and whether you think, in reality, it has  been useful?

[翻譯]
我的意思是凱西可能對此感興趣，但整個機構都不太感興趣。這段時期還有一件值得一提的事情，可能是在我認為是在‘84年期間進行了第一次夏季研究。問題4：等一下，在你離開政策委員會之前。你會在隨後的討論中回來討論它的成長和變化，以及你是否認為它在現實中是否有用嗎？

--- 段落 137 (377 字元) ---
- Marshall: We can do that, but I think probably we’ll do it next time.But I’ll say a  few words now.I think that the original notion that Sy Weiss pushed made it not  very useful.It was the idea that here is this set of wiser people who would listen  to things and then make judgments and give advice, but not really do any work.I think that was not a good way of functioning.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我們可以這樣做，但我想也許下次再做吧。但我現在先說幾句。我認為，西韋斯提出的最初概念讓它變得不太有用。那個概念是，這裡有一群更明智的人會傾聽事情然後做出判斷並給予建議，但實際上不會做任何工作。我認為那不是一種好的運作方式。

--- 段落 138 (499 字元) ---
I don’t know how it’s going to  function now, but it was evolving toward something a bit more like the Defense  Science Board.Not quite, but it is more helpful where there are task forces, people  really do some sort of work, and it’s not just off-the-top-of-the-head, seat-of-thepants reactions.- Q3: John Deutch [Deputy Secretary of Defense at the time of the talk] was involved  in it in the early days.And I remember he was pretty disgusted with the whole  business.That may affect his attitude.

[翻譯]
我不知道它現在將如何運作，但它正在演變成類似國防科學委員會的一些東西。雖然不完全如此，但在任務部隊存在的情況下更有幫助，人們確實在做一些工作，而不僅僅是一時衝動的反應。Q3：約翰·迪奇（當時的副國防部長）在早期參與其中。我記得他對整個業務感到相當厭惡。這可能影響他的態度。

--- 段落 139 (460 字元) ---
- Q2: Who was on it the first year?You said Rowen, Paul [Wolfowitz]…  
- Q3: Paul, John Deutch, Albert Wohlstetter, Fred Hoffman.I remember Sy Weiss  sitting Fred Hoffman down, and he said, “We’ll let you come to the meetings, but  you can’t vote the way Albert does all the time.” Sort of like Outer Mongolia and  the Soviet Union [both being in] in the [United Nations] General Assembly.Fred  Hoffman, being such a sweet guy, just sat there and said, “Right.

[翻譯]
- 問題2：第一年哪些人參加了？你說 Rowen、Paul [沃爾夫維茨]...
- 問題3：Paul、約翰迪奧特、阿爾伯特沃爾斯特特、弗雷德霍夫曼。我記得 Sy Weiss 讓弗雷德霍夫曼坐下來，他說：“我們讓你來參加會議，但你不能像阿爾伯特那樣一直投票。” 有點像外蒙古和蘇聯在[聯合國]大會中的情況。弗雷德霍夫曼，一個那麼和善的人，靜靜地坐在那裡說：“對的。”

”  
- Marshall: Bob Long [Retired Navy Admiral] was on it.- Q3: John Deutch, Larry Silberman…  
- Marshall: Oh, and Charles Herzfeld [former Director, Advanced Research Project  Agency].OK, the Summer Studies.The first Summer Study was run out of RDA in  L.A.in ‘85.- Q3: And then in ‘87 we did the Monterey business for the Discriminate Deterrence…  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：鮑勃·隆（退役海軍上將）參與其中。- Q3：約翰·迪奇、拉里·席爾伯曼…- 馬歇爾：噢，還有查爾斯·赫茲費爾德（前高級研究計畫署署長）。好的，夏季研究。第一次夏季研究是在1985年在洛杉磯的RDA進行的。- Q3：然後在1987年我們在蒙特雷進行了有目標的嚇阻的業務…- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

OK, another item: This negotiation with the Israelis about the “lessons learned”  activities that were to use their experience, any materiel they had gotten out of  the ‘82 War, turned into a fiasco.Dennis Ross and I and some other people went  over [in Nov 1982] to try to negotiate something with them.37 Anyway, I say this  just for the humor of it.We negotiated this long agreement.Weinberger thought  there should be just one page, some minimal kind of agreement.

[翻譯]
好的，另一個議題：這次與以色列關於要利用他們在'82年戰爭中獲得的經驗和裝備的“吸取教訓”活動的談判搞成了一場混亂。丹尼斯·羅斯和我以及其他一些人於1982年11月去那裡試圖與他們談判。無論如何，我提到這件事只是為了談笑之意。我們談判達成了這份漫長的協議。威恩伯格認為應該只有一頁，一些最小程度的協議。

--- 段落 142 (458 字元) ---
And they wanted this long, elaborate document, giving this or that access to the results that we  would have and so on.So we negotiated it and came to sort of an agreement that  was enough to take back, although I was doubtful that the people back here were  going to agree to all of it.Then I guess Ariel Sharon [Minister of Defense] because  of his own political interest decided to get some publicity out of the fact that this  agreement had been reached.

[翻譯]
他們希望有一份冗長、繁瑣的文件，提供我們將擁有的結果之類的訪問權。因此，我們進行了談判，達成了某種協議，足以帶回家，儘管我懷疑這裡的人們是否會同意所有內容。然後我想是因為亞里爾·沙龍（國防部長）出於自己的政治利益決定要從達成協議的事實中獲得一些宣傳。

[gap for tape change]  
- Q2: You were on TV?In Israel?- Marshall: In Israel.Just at this meeting.And it was leaked to the papers later and so  on.At any rate, I started off the meeting by telling him that we’d signed this thing,  but very likely people back in Washington were not going to agree.

[翻譯]
[更換錄音帶之間的間隙]
- Q2: 你在電視上露面了？在以色列嗎？ - 馬歇爾：是的，在以色列。就在這個會議上。然後後來這件事被泄露到報紙上等等。無論如何，我在會議一開始就告訴他，我們簽了這個協定，但很可能華盛頓回來的人士不會同意。

--- 段落 144 (440 字元) ---
In particular,  I mentioned that they [the Israelis] had insisted on, throughout this document,  the name or the phrase that they had used to designate this war—something  like “Peace in Galilee” [Operation Peace for Galilee] or something, I forget what  it was—and I had been instructed that we would not sign any document of this  sort.So I told him that.I said, “Look, I’m taking this back.We’ve gotten as far as  we can with this thing.

[翻譯]
尤其是，我提到他們（以色列人）一直堅持在這份文件中使用的名稱或短語，他們用來指定這場戰爭——類似“加利利和平”（加利利和平行動）之類的東西，我忘了是什麼，並且我已經被指示我們不會簽署這種文件。所以我告訴他。我說：“看，我帶這個回去。我們已經盡了最大努力。”

But I just want to tell you that very likely we’re not going  to sign any document that has this in it.” He then went off for about a 20-minute  tirade on, “‘We don’t tell you what to name your wars,” and went on and on and  on.And then at the end of it all, he asked my help in getting Weinberger to ship  off another $200 million that had been held up for something.

[翻譯]
但我只是想告訴你，很可能我們不會簽署任何文件中有這個的部分。"然後他發表了約20分鐘的激烈講話，"我們不告訴你要如何命名你們的戰爭，"然後不停地說著。最後，在談完所有事情後，他要求我幫助他讓 Weinberger 再運送2億美元，因為這筆款項一直被擱置著。

- Q3: Before we move on…You had this sort of discussions with the Israelis, but you  also had a set of ongoing discussions with the French and the Germans.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q3: The only reason I mention that is that my memory of the sessions that I went  to, a lot of the stuff that now gets referred to as the “military-technical revolution”  and the “revolution in military affairs” was presented in one guise or another, both  by the Germans and the French, and a little bit by us.

[翻譯]
問題三：在我們繼續之前...您與以色列人進行了這樣的討論，但您也與法國人和德國人進行了一系列的討論。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- 問題三：我提及的唯一原因是，我參與過的會議中，很多現在被稱為“軍事技術革命”和“軍事事務革命”的內容，或多或少都是由德國人和法國人提出的，還有我們略微提到的。

--- 段落 147 (436 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: This was also following on some of the “lessons learned” from these Middle Eastern  wars, but also some of the early work on the impact of precision guided munitions.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q3: Again, I wouldn’t [indistinct] seems like a lot of your interest in what we now  call the “revolution in military affairs” stems from this period, and you used that in  discussions with other governments.Is that right?

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3：這也是基於從這些中東戰爭中吸取的一些“經驗教訓”，以及對精密制導彈藥影響的早期研究。- 馬歇爾：對，沒錯。- Q3：再次，我認為您現在所謂的“軍事事務革命”中很多關注，源於這個時期，您曾與其他政府討論過這些問題。這樣理解對嗎？

--- 段落 148 (484 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, I would locate my interest in this really from the Russian writings  which we became aware of—their internal, still-secret writings—in the late ‘70s,  which became more public in the early ‘80s, ‘83 or so, in particular, and also the  analysis of exercises that we were aware of.In, say, ‘79, they were already beginning to look at how to counter reconnaissance-strike complexes and so on.So we  were interested in that set of ideas increasingly through that period.

[翻譯]
Marshall：嗯，我對這個感興趣，主要是從我們在70年代末意識到的俄羅斯的內部、仍然保密的著作開始，這些作品在80年代初，尤其是在‘83左右變得更為公開，以及我們已經意識到的演習分析。比如說，到了‘79年，他們已經開始研究如何對抗偵察打擊體系等。所以我們在這段時間逐漸對這一套想法產生了興趣。

--- 段落 149 (224 字元) ---
And then at  the time of the Iklé-Wohlstetter thing [the Commission on Integrated Long-Term  Strategy],which began in the summer of ‘86, we did this assessment of the next 20  years in which that was one of the major themes.

[翻譯]
然後在山姆貝爾·艾克勒和羅伯特·沃爾斯泰特展開的長期整合戰略委員會（Iklé-Wohlstetter thing）期間，該委員會於1986年夏天開始，我們對接下來20年進行了評估，其中這是其中一個主要主題。

--- 段落 150 (471 字元) ---
38  Just to leap ahead: It’s kind of symptomatic of this denial of Soviet weakness that Iklé  as late as ‘88 required that Charlie Wolf and I use, in effect, the CIA estimates of Soviet  GNP as the base case in our projections, which was not what we believed, and we  put in the variants.39 If it had been left to us, we would have put a much lower estimate of Soviet GNP as the base case and the OA [CIA estimates] as a nutty variant.- Q8: Did you hit Iklé on that, too?

[翻譯]
38. 就在這裡提前：這種對蘇聯弱點的否認似乎是一種症狀，以至於直到1988年，伊克勒要求查理·沃爾夫和我在我們的預測中實際上使用中情局對蘇聯國內生產總值的估計作為基本情況，這不是我們的看法，所以我們加入了變體。如果完全由我們做決定，我們會將蘇聯國內生產總值的估計設定得更低，而將OA（中情局的估計）作為荒謬的變體。- 問題8：你對此也責怪過伊克勒嗎？

--- 段落 151 (476 字元) ---
- Marshall: He had two objections to things that we wanted to do.One was that we  wanted to put a little emphasis on AIDS as a problem…And secondly, any portrayal of the Soviets as weak or smaller as opponents was not to be highlighted.But certainly by the middle ‘80s, I very much saw this as a major theme, and  certainly included it in the NATO-Warsaw Pact assessments that were done.And  I’m sure that we talked some about that with the French and the Germans and  others.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：他對我們想做的事情有兩個異議。一個是我們想將艾滋病作為一個問題放在輕度強調。其次，任何將蘇聯描繪為弱者或對手較小的形象都不應被突顯。但到了80年代中期，我非常認為這是一個主要主題，當然也包括在進行的北約-華沙條約評估中。我肯定我們當時與法國人、德國人和其他國家就這個問題進行了一些討論。

--- 段落 152 (474 字元) ---
- Q3: What sticks in my mind is that both general staff officers from the German army  and from the French army talked about their ideas about the nature of battlefield  tactics—  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q3: —and operational behavior in a battlefield in which information was available  to everybody, where everybody else was, and the importance of stealth on the  battlefield, of tactics which mingled your forces with those of the enemy so they  couldn’t be sorted out.

[翻譯]
Q3: 我記憶猶新的是德國軍隊和法國軍隊的軍官都討論了他們對戰場戰術性質的看法 -  
Marshall: 是的，沒錯。- Q3: - 在一個所有人都能取得信息、大家都知道對方位置的戰場中，掩密行動的重要性以及將自己部隊與敵軍混合在一起的戰術，使之無法分辨。

--- 段落 153 (454 字元) ---
I was just kind of struck by—  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.The French in particular…  
- Q3: Colonel [indistinct] was a very impressive guy.- Marshall: Yeah, right.The discussions with the French, which did start in this period,  began in ‘81.The approach had been made to Robert Komer [Under Secretary of  Defense for Policy] in the middle of ‘80, and Komer had assigned us to undertake  those.The first meeting, I think, was in Paris in the spring of ‘81.

[翻譯]
我只是有點震驚——
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。尤其是法國人…
- Q3：某某上校是一個非常令人印象深刻的人物。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。這個時期開始進行與法國人的討論，始於1981年。在1980年中期曾向羅伯特·科默（國防部政策次長）提出過建議，科默委派我們進行這些事務。我想第一次會議是在1981年春季在巴黎召開的。

--- 段落 154 (442 字元) ---
- Q8: And the French—I misunderstood—the French did or didn’t have the idea that  the Soviets are weak?- Q3: They may or may not.I don’t recall them discussing that specifically, but they  did— We, the French and American delegations, seemed to be engaged in a dialogue about the nature of what we now call the “military-technical revolution.”  
- Marshall: Yeah, that’s true.- Q3: But what was the purpose of the discussions with the French?

[翻譯]
- 問題8：而法國人——我誤解了——法國人有沒有認為蘇聯軍事能力較弱的想法？
- 問題3：可能有，也可能沒有。我不記得他們有具體討論過這個問題，但我們，法國和美國代表團，似乎正就我們現在所謂的「軍事技術革命」的性質進行對話。
- 馬歇爾：是的，這是真的。
- 問題3：但是和法國進行討論的目的是什麼？

--- 段落 155 (462 字元) ---
Was it just to…  
- Marshall: It came on the French initiative, through the attaché, who they approached wanting to create another channel for discussion of particular problems, sharing of information, and so on.- Q2: I think the French were doing that because of the Israeli talks?- Marshall: No, I don’t think so.I don’t think so.I don’t think they particularly knew  about the Israeli talks prior to this.Well, I don’t really have anything much more [to say].

[翻譯]
這是否僅僅是為了...  
- 馬歇爾：這是由法國方面發起的，透過他們的武官，他們接洽想要建立另一個討論特定問題、分享信息等的途徑。  
- Q2：我想法國這樣做是因為以色列的談判嗎？  
- 馬歇爾：不，我不這麼認為。我不覺得他們特別知道這之前涉及以色列的談判。哦，我沒有太多想說的了。

--- 段落 156 (444 字元) ---
Maybe some of you have…  
- Q3: Well, how about the changes in the orientation of the office?You didn’t kind of  take the office as a topic.- Marshall: Well, as I say, we came into this particular period from what we were doing in the years with Brown, during which things were going very well, and so we  had a bunch of things, and so in the first few years of the Reagan Administration  we were finishing off various things and continuing on.

[翻譯]
也許有些人對此有所了解...
- Q3:辦公室的方向性變化如何？你不太像談論辦公室這個話題。
- 馬歇爾:嗯，就像我說的，我們從布朗那個時期進入這個特定時期，當時情況非常好，所以我們有很多事情要處理，在里根政府的最初幾年，我們完成了許多事情並繼續進行。

--- 段落 157 (402 字元) ---
But then, it was, I thought,  very clear that Weinberger just didn’t have any interest.And so the number of  assessments, I think, began to trickle off, and there were other things that Iklé  had us involved in.It got worse in ‘85, with the competitive strategies thing being  added on.And there was also the start up, then, of the Wohlstetter commission  [Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy].

[翻譯]
但當時，我覺得韋恩伯格顯然對這沒有興趣。我想，評估的數量開始減少，伊克爾還讓我們參與了其他事情。到了1985年，情況變得更糟糕，競爭戰略被添加進來。此外，沃爾斯特特委員會 [綜合長期戰略委員會]也開始運作。

--- 段落 158 (481 字元) ---
But before that, there had been something which I had forgotten entirely about,  which was a big set of activities which had to do with this effort to look at the  strategic forces—the whole set of games that Charlie Pease did.- Q2: Oh, the NSDG [Nuclear Strategy Development Group] games?- Marshall: Yeah, the NSDG effort, which was an initiative that Fred Iklé started, I suppose, given that this was probably in ‘83, and just about the time of the Strategic  Defense Initiative.

[翻譯]
但在那之前，有一件事情我完全忘記了，那就是一個與努力審視戰略力量有關的一系列活動，這些活動與查理皮斯開展的整個遊戲集有關。Q2:哦，NSDG（核戰略發展小組）的遊戲嗎？-馬歇爾：是的，NSDG的努力，這是弗雷德·艾克勒啟動的一個倡議，我想，因為這可能是在‘83年，正好是戰略防禦倡議出現的時候。

--- 段落 159 (477 字元) ---
It wasn’t triggered by the SDI, but it sort of became part of it.The whole idea was that we have this elaborate Master Plan [Nuclear Weapons  Employment and Acquisition Master Plan] for our forces that runs through the  early ‘80s, or up to ‘85—I forget the exact dates of it now.There was this Master Plan for fixing up the strategic forces, and Iklé thought we  needed to look at the period beyond there, because, first, the target system was  changing, becoming much harder.

[翻譯]
這並非由SDI引發的，但它在某種程度上成為其中的一部分。整個構想是，我們對部隊制定了一個精心策劃的總體計劃[核武器運用和採購總體計劃]，涵蓋了80年代初期，或者是遲至85年 - 我現在忘記了確切日期。這份總體計劃是為了改善戰略部隊，伊克勒認為我們需要考慮超出那個時期，因為首先，目標系統正在變化，變得更加困難。

--- 段落 160 (403 字元) ---
As a result of the change in targeting policy  we’ve already touched on, they began looking for the leadership things.We find  all this whole new range of hardened targets.You look at what’s happening on  the silo upgrades, changes and so on.In other words, just a whole set of things  are happening on the Soviet side so the target system…  
- Q2: Started going to mobiles.- Marshall: Yeah…is changing.

[翻譯]
由於我們已經提到的定位政策的改變，他們開始尋找領導層的事物。我們發現了一整套新的強化目標。你看看發生在發射井升級、改變等方面的事情。換句話說，蘇聯方面正在發生一整套變化，目標系統...- Q2: 開始轉向機動目標。- Marshall: 是的...正在改變。

--- 段落 161 (493 字元) ---
Then along comes SDI, or the possibility of missile  defenses, and the questions arises, “Will you want to shift to a defense-dominated strategy?How should you be thinking about all of this?” So he wanted to get  started with the studies to look at the period beyond the Master Plan.So we ran  a lot of the activities for him.One, there was this set of games.But there were  other studies that were done that we were responsible for.There was an analysis  working group that I chaired for him.

[翻譯]
然後出現了SDI，或者是飛彈防禦的可能性，於是問題出現了，“你會想轉向防禦主導的戰略嗎？你應該如何思考這一切？”所以他想要開始研究，以探討主計劃以後的時期。因此，我們為他執行了許多活動。其中一個是一系列的遊戲。但也有其他我們負責的研究。我替他主持的一個分析工作小組。

--- 段落 162 (479 字元) ---
All of these activities began to displace the assessments, and we were down, I  think, to continuing— We were doing the NATO-Warsaw Pact by the end.We were  doing the Investment Balance.I think we continued to try to do a few things in power  projection.But we were narrowed down quite a bit, and only began to expand back  into this net assessment business when the Bush Administration came to power.- Q4: At this point in time, you’ve been in Washington a little over 10 years.

[翻譯]
所有這些活動開始取代評估，我們降低到繼續 - 我想，我們在最後那時期在做北約-華沙條約。我們在進行投資平衡。我想我們繼續嘗試進行一些權力投射。但我們受到很大的限制，只有在布什政府上台時才開始擴大回到這個網路評估業務中。- Q4: 在這個時候，你在華盛頓已經超過10年了。

--- 段落 163 (440 字元) ---
You’ve  been in [the Office of the Secretary of Defense] for about 10 years.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q4: What are you thinking about in terms of going back to California?Is this analysis  effort succeeding or failing?What were your sentiments?- Q3: You were pretty grumpy at the time as I recall.- Marshall: Yes.Right.I don’t remember exactly, but, yes, I think that’s right.And I was  probably thinking a lot more about going back to California.

[翻譯]
你已在國防部長辦公室工作了大約10年了。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q4：在考慮回加利福尼亞的事情時，你在想些什麼？這個分析努力是否成功或失敗？你當時的感受是什麼？- Q3：據我記得，你當時相當暴躁。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。我記不太清楚，但是我想這是對的。當時我可能想著回加利福尼亞的事情更多。

--- 段落 164 (407 字元) ---
- Q2: Now, why do you think Weinberger never picked up on this Soviet weakness  stuff?He clearly was very interested in doing as much as he could do across the  board on defense spending to get forces up and everything to oppose them…  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: A big proponent of SDI.And in many ways, that’s just the culmination of the  whole cost-imposing thing.So, why not?Beyond political reasons.

[翻譯]
Q2: 為什麼你認為韋恩伯格從未注意到這個蘇聯的弱點？顯然他對在國防支出上盡力所能，以對抗他們增強軍力方面非常感興趣…
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q2：他是一個SDI的堅定支持者。在許多方面，這只是整個成本加重的事情的頂點。那為什麼呢？除了政治原因之外。

--- 段落 165 (487 字元) ---
One could  understand why you wouldn’t want to give the political opposition any notion  at all that they could do less because the other guys were weak, as opposed to  doing more and driving them into the grave.If you said too much, “Aw, they’re  weak over there,” then everybody says, “Well hell, we can cut the budget then, if  they’re weak.” But setting that aside, was there some really fundamental problem?He wanted to do all these things, but he didn’t have an objective?Is that….

[翻譯]
有人可以理解為什麼你不想讓政治對手產生這樣的念頭，以為他們可以做得更少，而不是更多，將他們逼上絕路。如果你說得太多，“噢，他們那邊很弱”，那麼每個人都會說，“好吧，如果他們很弱，我們就可以削減預算。”但撇開這些不談，是否存在一個真正的基本問題？他想做所有這些事情，但他沒有目標？這是....

--- 段落 166 (460 字元) ---
- Marshall: I don’t know.I don’t know how he felt about me.I saw him only two or  three times or so.So I don’t know what he thought.But I see no signs in the discussions that I know of, or heard anything about, that he had any understanding  of the economics of the situation.And obviously tactically bad.Whether, as this  book Victory alleges, he was part of an inner group that understood this all and  was pursuing this strategy…Maybe he kept it to himself.

[翻譯]
Marshall：我不知道。我不知道他對我有什麼感覺。我只見過他兩三次。所以我不知道他怎麼想。但在我知道的討論中，我看不出他對情況的經濟有任何了解。很明顯，戰略方面有問題。至於《勝利》這本書聲稱的，他是否是理解這一切並追求這種策略的內部團隊的一部分……也許他自己留著。

--- 段落 167 (436 字元) ---
I don’t believe that, but  it’s possible.- Q8: On the pipeline issue, Weinberger totally was with hawks.- Marshall: Yeah, well so was Perle and everybody.There was a whole set of people  here that were very much against that.- Q8: Was there anything in ‘84 about Weinberger giving the order to shut down the  Office of Net Assessment?Did you hear anything about how the Joint Staff was  going to create its own office of net assessment?

[翻譯]
我不相信那個，但這是可能的。- Q8：在管道問題上，溫伯格完全站在鷹派一方。- 馬歇爾：是的，帕爾和大家也是這樣。這裡有一整群人非常反對那件事。- Q8：有關溫伯格在1984年是否下令關閉網絡評估辦公室的事情嗎？你有聽說過聯合參謀會如何建立自己的網絡評估辦公室嗎？

--- 段落 168 (388 字元) ---
And get public release rights for  every assessment wherever it would be done?That this office [ONA] would not  ever be allowed again to testify in public?Q3: Yeah.There was gossip that the JCS wanted to take over the net assessment  function entirely.Q2: It was more than gossip.They tried to get that under the Goldwater-Nichols  [Defense Reorganization Act of 1986).40  Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
而且獲得每個評估的公開發布權，無論在哪裡進行？這個辦公室[全國安全事務局]將不再被允許在公開場合作證？Q3：是的。有謠言稱聯合參謀會想要完全接管網路評估功能。Q2：這不僅僅是謠言。他們試圖在高沃特-尼科爾斯法案[1986年國防重整法]下實現這一目標。40 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 169 (364 字元) ---
- Q2: They got it insinuated in some way in the Packard Commission [President’s  Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management],41 and then they tried to get  the language in Goldwater-Nichols structured in such a way that, well, they did  get it structured in such a way that they were given the charge by Congress for  conducting net assessments.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
Q2:他們在某種程度上在帕卡德委員會[總統藍絲帶國防管理委員會]裡引入了這個概念，然後他們試圖讓高沃特-尼科爾斯法案的措辭以某種方式結構化，他們確實讓其結構化，以便負責進行淨評估的任務由議會決定。- 馬歇爾: 是的。

--- 段落 170 (499 字元) ---
- Q2: And they tried to argue that they gave them sort of a higher moral authority  because theirs came from Congress, whereas this office’s only came from the Secretary of Defense.And so therefore, they should have the lead on doing all that.I  mean, this is looking forward to the next session.- Q8: I was told that by the special assistant to Weinberger in roughly May ‘84.When I  said I really wanted to go over there and work with Andy Marshall, she said, “Don’t  you know he’s being shut down?

[翻譯]
Q2: 他們試圖主張他們擁有更高的道德權威，因為他們的權威來自國會，而這個職位的權威只來自國防部長。因此，他們應該在處理所有事務上擁有主導地位。我是說，這是在展望下一輪會議。
Q8: 大約在1984年5月左右，韋恩伯格的特別助理告訴我這個消息。當我說我真的很想去那裡和安迪·馬歇爾一起工作時，她說，“你不知道他正在被關閉嗎？”。

--- 段落 171 (496 字元) ---
Weinberger has decided to shut down that  office.” I remember being quite startled.And as I remember, there were a number  of steps taken involving senators calling Weinberger, saying, “You shouldn’t do  that,” in June and July, I think it was, of ‘84.Phil Merrill [publisher of the Washingtonian magazine] also got into it.He was quite panicked by this concept.And  when given…When asked why, Weinberger’s special assistant said there are two  reasons.The office never does anything, number one.

[翻譯]
韋恩伯格已決定關閉那個辦公室。我記得當時感到非常震驚。我記得，1984年6月和7月間，參議員們採取了一系列措施，打電話給韋恩伯格，說：“您不應該這樣做。” 菲爾·梅里爾（《華盛頓人》雜誌的出版商）也參與其中。他對這個概念感到非常恐慌。當被問及為什麼時，韋恩伯格的特別助理說有兩個原因。首先，這個辦公室從來沒做過任何事情。

--- 段落 172 (322 字元) ---
They never produce any  assessments.This is not her opinion; she’s reflecting what she’d heard discussed  around Weinberger.Number two, the Joint Staff—or a word like that, I don’t know  the exact…whether it was J-5 or JCS, or the Joint…the word “Joint” is in there—  was real angry about the way the assessments come out.

[翻譯]
他們從不製作任何評估。這不是她的觀點；她只是在反映她聽到的關於韋恩伯格周圍討論的事情。第二，聯合參謀部——或者類似的詞語，我不確定…是J-5還是JCS，或者聯合…詞語“聯合”出現在那裡 — 對評估的發布方式感到非常憤怒。

--- 段落 173 (333 字元) ---
And looking back—this is not something that happened at the time—but  looking back, I think the Soviet weakness argument, perception, or whatever you  want to call it, brilliant analysis, was causing real political enemies to be formed,  that you cannot— This office was being misperceived as a liberal, sort of left-wing  operation.

[翻譯]
回顧過去，這不是當時發生的事情，但回顧過去，我認為蘇聯弱點論證，觀念，或者你想叫它什麼，都導致了真正的政治敵人的形成，你無法 - 這個辦公室被誤解為是一個自由主義的、左翼的運作。

--- 段落 174 (429 字元) ---
Because at the time, the Federation of American Scientists…there’s a  unit of public opinion in America at the time saying the Russians are weak, they  want peace, we should extend the hand of friendship.And some of Marshall’s  arguments were being scrambled with the American left-wing view, and therefore seen as mutiny or treasonous against Weinberger’s patriotic efforts to sell the  Services’ budgets on the Hill.- Q3: Yeah.

[翻譯]
因為當時美國科學家聯盟...當時美國有一個公共輿論部門認為俄羅斯人很軟弱，他們想要和平，我們應該伸出友誼之手。馬歇爾的一些論點被混淆為美國左派觀點，因此被視為對魏恩伯格爭取在國會通過服務預算的愛國努力的叛變或叛國行為。- Q3: 是的。

--- 段落 175 (149 字元) ---
It sort of feeds back into the idea that by talking about Soviet vulnerabilities,  you sort of gave ammunition to the left wing in the United States.

[翻譯]
這在某種程度上反映出，談論蘇聯的弱點，你實際上為美國左翼提供了弹药。

--- 段落 176 (411 字元) ---
I think it came  back in what was one of Weinberger’s few marginalia on the Investment Balance,  which contains some idea, “Look, the Soviets have this big advantage over us in  invested military capital, but one response the United States might take would be  to undertake new military programs to render obsolete some portion of the Soviet military capital stock.” Which I believe Weinberger’s response to Mr.

[翻譯]
我認為這可以追溯到韋恩伯格在《投資平衡》上很少有的一個旁注，其中包含了一些想法：“看，蘇聯在投資軍事資本方面對我們具有巨大優勢，但美國可能採取的一種回應是啟動新的軍事計劃，使蘇聯軍事資本庫中的部分資產變得過時。”我相信韋恩伯格對先生的回應。

--- 段落 177 (437 字元) ---
Marshall—  obviously he remembers better than I do—[was], “Is he one of those liberals who  thinks the Soviet military is full of obsolete equipment and therefore is no good?”  
- Q8: So that’s around here somewhere?That handwritten note is around here?- Q3: I think it was in marginalia on the short version that was sent up.David Epstein  perhaps knows something about that?So that’s the only concrete piece of evidence that I know of.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾──顯然他比我記得得更清楚──「他是那種認為蘇聯軍隊裝備過時，因此無用的自由派嗎？」
- Q8：那大概在這附近？在這附近有那張手寫的便條嗎？- Q3：我想是在寄上去的簡短版本的註釋上。大衛·艾普斯坦也許知道一些關於那個的事情？那是我所知道的唯一具體證據。

--- 段落 178 (303 字元) ---
- Q8: When Senator Orrin Hatch came over to see Weinberger about Pillsbury joining  the Defense Department, that was one of the topics, that is, his decision to shut  down…  
- Q3: [Indistinct] confined to Weinberger, because Andy, as always, had many adherents in the senior leadership of the military.

[翻譯]
Q8：當參議員奧林·哈奇前來與韋恩伯格討論皮尔斯伯里加入國防部的事宜時，這是其中一個話題，也就是他關閉的決定...
Q3：[不清楚] 主要集中在韋恩伯格身上，因為安迪總是在軍方高級領導中有許多支持者。

--- 段落 179 (464 字元) ---
And I don’t think the outcome of  the Balances that I was aware of annoyed— For example, remember that famous  occasion when we all went out to Pearl Harbor to brief Admiral William Crowe  [Commander in Chief, Pacific Command, 1983–1985] on the East Asia Balance?A  lot of people on Admiral Crowe’s staff didn’t like the Balance, but Admiral Crowe  looked at the thing and said, “Yeah, yeah, looks good.Count on Andy to come up  with something sensible,” you know.

[翻譯]
我認為我當時知道的平衡結果並沒有讓人感到惱火 - 例如，還記得我們一起到珍珠港向太平洋司令部司令威廉·克羅伊上將 [1983-1985年的太平洋司令] 關於東亞平衡進行簡報的著名場合嗎？克羅伊上將的許多幕僚對這個平衡不滿意，但克羅伊上將看了一下，說，“是的，是的，看起來不錯。可以信任安迪提出一些合理的東西，你知道的。”

--- 段落 180 (368 字元) ---
And Admiral Long [Crowe’s predecessor as  CINCPAC] was a fan of Andy’s.So I think Weinberger had one set of perceptions  and the senior leadership of the military was different.- Q8: I never got a name of an individual, general or admiral, who was sort of out to  abolish Net Assessment…Somehow this thing called “Joint Military [Net] Assessment”  …I lost track of it.

[翻譯]
而長官隆將軍 [克羅的前任 CINCPAC] 是 Andy 的粉絲。所以我認為 Weinberger 有一套觀念，而軍方高層的觀念是不同的。-- Q8：我從未得知任何一個將軍或海軍上將的名字，他似乎要廢除網路評估...一些名為“聯合軍事[網絡]評估”的事情...我對此失去了追踪。

--- 段落 181 (468 字元) ---
The next thing I know people are coming to sit in offices, handing  people copies of this thing called “Joint Military [Net] Assessment,” JCS on the cover.- Marshall: Yeah, well that’s later.- Q2: That comes after Goldwater-Nichols and that’s their first thing.J-5 did something on it, and we have a whole process set up to do these things on it.Coordinated, Net Assessment Coordinating Committee we set up—  
- Marshall: Right.- Q2: —and all that in response to this.

[翻譯]
接下來我知道的是人們開始到辦公室坐下，交給人們這份名為“聯合軍事[網絡]評估”的東西副本，封面上寫著JCS。- 馬歇爾：是的，這是後來的事情。- Q2：這是在Goldwater-Nichols之後出現的，這是他們的第一件事情。J-5在這件事上做了一些事情，我們建立了一個完整的流程來處理這些事情。我們建立了一個協調的網絡評估協調委員會- 
- 馬歇爾：就是這樣。- Q2：- 這一切都是對這個的回應。

--- 段落 182 (347 字元) ---
And, you know, J-5 tried to use that to capture  the flag, the whole net assessment flag.It was all pressure from the Hill, by the  way, for net assessments.This was just being written into legislation, “You will do  net assessment on this, you’ll do net assessment on that.” They use the phrase “net  assessment” in ways that this office doesn’t.

[翻譯]
而你知道，J-5試圖利用這個來奪取整個網絡評估旗子。這其實是受到來自國會壓力的，要求進行網絡評估。這其實已經被寫入法律，“你將對這進行網絡評估，你將對那進行網絡評估。” 他們使用“網絡評估”這個詞彙的方式，這個辦公室並不一樣。

--- 段落 183 (448 字元) ---
So, you, “You’ll do a net assessment  on which way rivers flow, and why they do that,” things like that, I mean everything, partly because Tony Cordesman was over there.He was kind of writing  [that] everything had to have a net assessment to it.- Marshall: Right.- Q2: It’s his [Cordesman’s] way, I think, of bolstering the importance of the office.But  then there was this sense that these were becoming increasingly important and  demanded, etc.

[翻譯]
所以，你會做一個關於河流流向以及為什麼會這樣的網絡評估，類似這樣的事情，我指的是所有事情，部分原因是因為托尼·科德斯曼在那裡。他有一種寫作的風格，認為所有事情都應該有一個網絡評估。- 馬歇爾：沒錯。- Q2：我覺得這是他（科德斯曼）的方式，用來加強辦公室的重要性。但是後來有一種感覺，這些變得越來越重要並且被要求等等。

--- 段落 184 (484 字元) ---
So the JCS thought they must be good and they didn’t want this  office doing it.So they wanted to capture the thing for themselves.The only general  officer I know—and again this is a feedback to Weinberger—Arnie Schlossberg, who  was the head of the Chief of Staff of the Army’s staff group as a colonel, and the  Chief was General John Wickham, and then Schlossberg got his first star and went  down to J-5, so he was involved in this kind of stuff, although I met him as a colonel.

[翻譯]
因此，聯合參謀會議認為他們必須做得更好，他們不希望這個辦公室負責這件事情。因此他們想獨自佔有這件事情。我唯一認識的將軍，也是一個反饋給韋恩伯格的情況，是阿尼·施洛斯伯格。他曾作為陸軍參謀長的參謀團主任（上校），而參謀長是約翰·維克漢將軍。後來施洛斯伯格升為少將並轉到J-5，因此他參與了這類事情，雖然我首次見到他時他還是上校。

He once pulled me aside at a conference up at Harvard, when, I think, he was the  deputy J-5, and said, “You know, you really ought to get out of that office because,  you know, Weinberger just doesn’t think very highly of it all [indistinct] Marshall.”  
- Q8: ‘85 this was?- Q2: Yeah, somewhere thereabouts.- Q3: Did he go to MacDill Air Force Base [Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force and  Central Command headquarters] after that?

[翻譯]
有一次在哈佛大學的一個會議上，當時他應該是副J-5，他拉著我一邊說：“你知道嗎，你真的應該離開那個辦公室，因為韋恩伯格根本對這一切不看重 [不清楚] 馬歇爾。”
- Q8：這是在85年嗎？- Q2：是的，大約是那個時候。- Q3：之後他去了麥克迪爾空軍基地[快速部署聯合特遣部隊和中央指揮部]嗎？

--- 段落 186 (327 字元) ---
- Q2: Well, he got his second star and went off and did something else.- Q3: What was it, like RDJTF [Eds: Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force]?- Q2: Well no, it was CENTCOM.- Q8: One of the things that Senator Hatch said to Weinberger was about China.He  praised the Asia assessment; how the Senator knows about this, who knows?

[翻譯]
- Q2：嗯，他得到了第二顆星，然後離開去做其他事情了。
- Q3：這是什麼，像是RDJTF [註：快速部署聯合特遣部隊] 嗎？
- Q2：不，是CENTCOM。
- Q8：哈奇參議員對韋恩伯格說的一件事與中國有關。他讚揚了對亞洲的評估；參議員是如何知道這件事的，誰知道呢？

--- 段落 187 (472 字元) ---
Weinberger perked up—I was in the meeting—Weinberger perked up and he did  not seem to know that Net Assessment had said that there’s a big payoff if we do  things with China on [indistinct] used the term “imposing costs.” That’s why I wanted to underline the part in the assessment about the tremendous costs of doing  things in Siberia.There’s about ten pages in there—God knows how you dug all  that out—but it’s tractors and trucks, and building roads, and permafrost.

[翻譯]
韋恩伯格振作起來 - 我當時在會議中 - 韋恩伯格振作起來，他好像不知道網絡評估說過，如果我們在中國採取行動，會有很大的回報，他使用了“強制成本”一詞。這就是為什麼我想強調評估中關於在西伯利亞採取行動所帶來的巨大成本。評估報告中有約十頁內容 - 天曉得你是如何找到所有這些內容的 - 但其中提到拖拉機、卡車、修建道路和永久凍土。

--- 段落 188 (481 字元) ---
- Q3: There were studies of oil exploration in Siberia and that was the basis for what  we had.- Q8: And Weinberger, of course, had just been to China for the first time in ‘83.We  hadn’t sold anything in terms of weapons yet.We did that in ‘86.Then they came…I  noticed in his memoirs, he really plays up his China trips and going to upgrade the  Chinese MiG-23s with American avionics and— He’s very proud of his China role.- Q2: That wasn’t a great idea.- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
Q3：在西伯利亞進行了石油勘探研究，這成為我們所擁有的基礎。- Q8：當然，魏茵伯格在83年首次造訪過中國。當時我們還沒有出售任何的武器。我們是在86年才開始這麼做的。然後他們來了......我注意到他在回憶錄中非常強調他的中國之行，與中國升級MiG-23飛機搭載美國航空電子設備 - 他為自己在中國的角色感到非常自豪。- Q2：那不是一個好主意。- 馬歇爾：是的，對。

--- 段落 189 (486 字元) ---
- Q8: Through the second term and Bush and later comes more the Asia stuff, but the  seeds begin in this 1980 100-page-plus Asia assessment, which was not offensive,  I would think, to the Joint Staff, if they ever saw it.Of course, [indistinct] none of  your studies, apparently, so they really didn’t know what you were saying.They  would just know from conferences or meetings.- Marshall: No, we sent copies of that all over the place.- Q3: It was briefed to the CNO Executive Panel.

[翻譯]
Q8：經過布希和後來更多與亞洲有關的事情，但種子開始於這個1980年超過100頁的亞洲評估，我認為這對聯合參謀部來說並不冒犯，如果他們看過的話。當然，[不清楚]显然，他们没有看過你的研究，所以他们真的不知道你在說甚麼。他們可能只是從會議或會議中了解。- 馬歇爾：不，我們把這份報告傳到很多地方去。- Q3：這份報告是提交給CNO執行小組的。

--- 段落 190 (353 字元) ---
- Q8: No, I mean all assessments.A J-5 colonel could not lay his hands on all of Mr.Marshall’s assessments.- Marshall: No, no.I mean we send them there and they systematically destroy them.They have no memory…  
- Q2: In fact, one of the first things they did when they tried to capture the net assessment flag was they wanted copies of all assessments.

[翻譯]
Q8：不，我是指所有評估。一位中校無法得到馬歇爾先生所有的評估文件。- 馬歇爾：不，不。我是指我們將它們送到那裡，然後他們會有系統地摧毀它們。它們沒有記憶…
Q2：實際上，當他們試圖捕獲網絡評估旗帜時，他們做的第一件事就是要求複印所有評估文件。

--- 段落 191 (439 字元) ---
- Q3: One of the, I think, more successful stories was something which you didn’t talk  about at all, which is the whole effort to develop Soviet-style assessments—  
- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: —which I think actually was useful in itself, and also kind of caught on in the  larger community.- Marshall: Yeah, that’s right.That continued on through this period.- Q5: Which is progress.A lot of progress was made on that.- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
- Q3: 我認為其中一個比較成功的故事是您完全沒提到的事情，那就是整個發展蘇聯風格評估的努力。
- Marshall: 是的。
- Q3: 我認為這其實本身是有用的，而且也在更大的社群中開始流行起來。
- Marshall: 是的，沒錯。這個努力一直持續到這個時期。
- Q5: 這是進步。在這方面取得了很大的進展。
- Marshall: 是的，沒錯。

--- 段落 192 (396 字元) ---
- Q3: Because it was something that you could— Remember [indistinct] had the very  intelligent idea from you about setting up schools to teach people how to do Soviet-style— So you could propagate it throughout the bureaucracy and it wasn’t  the exclusive possession of—  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.That’s true.I don’t know the timing of all that.It certainly was  continuing on during this period.

[翻譯]
Q3：因為這是你可以做的事情－記得[不清楚]你有一個非常聰明的想法，建立學校教導人們如何學習蘇聯式的－這樣你就可以在整個官僚體系中傳播它，而不是只屬於－
Marshall：是的，沒錯。這是真的。我不知道這一切的時間安排。這在這段時間肯定是繼續進行的。

--- 段落 193 (441 字元) ---
And I remember—I guess I’d have to look at the  records—we had a number of meetings with people like Fritz Ermarth [National  Intelligence Officer for the USSR and Eastern Europe], and General William Odom  [Army Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence], and a guy from [the Defense Intelligence Agency]…  
- Q3: Gordon Negus.- Marshall: Right.And I forget when John Hines first came to the office.And Steve  Rosen came during this period.

[翻譯]
我記得──我想我得查查記錄──我們與弗里茨·厄瑪斯（國家情報官員，負責蘇聯和東歐）、威廉·奧多姆將軍（陸軍情報參謀長助理）、一名來自國防情報局的人等許多人進行過幾次會議...
- Q3: 高登·內格斯。- 馬歇爾: 是的。我忘了約翰·海因斯第一次什麼時候來到辦公室。史蒂夫·羅森在這段時間裡也加入了。

--- 段落 194 (470 字元) ---
- Q2: And you had started the Foreign Systems Research Center at SAIC in Denver,  John Battilega and Judy Grange and Project Eager out there.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: In fact, they taught a week-long course on Soviet-style assessments.And you  got the intelligence community to actually start looking at that.- Marshall: Yeah, right.And Odom started to do stuff with the Army.- Q2: And actually started getting some information that, you know, was useful.- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
Q2: 你曾在SAIC的丹佛外國系統研究中心成立，那裡有約翰·巴蒂萊加、裘迪·格蘭吉和Project Eager - 馬歇爾：對。 - Q2: 事實上，他們在那裡教授了一週的蘇聯式評估課程。你實際上讓情報界開始關注這一點。 - 馬歇爾：對，是的。奧多姆開始和陸軍合作。 - Q2: 實際上開始獲得了一些有用的信息。 - 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 195 (192 字元) ---
- Q5: The first balance in which that was really well laid out was the strategic net  assessment that you were talking about during this period.- Marshall: Yeah.It came out in ‘82, ‘83 [1983].

[翻譯]
Q5: 第一次真正詳細制定平衡的是你在這段時間談論的戰略淨評估。
- Marshall：是的。這是在1982年，1983年發表的。

--- 段落 196 (487 字元) ---
- Q5: Going back to these issues about how things were perceived outside the  office… I seem to remember initially on that NATO-Pact Balance that Dave Andre  began that we really got around to a clear understanding that their view of the  balance was really much more pessimistic than what we said, you know, in Soviet  Military Power, I mean.There were a lot of unhappy campers about that whole  story, although I think it was well-documented.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q3: You’re right.

[翻譯]
問題5：回到有關人們如何看待辦公室之外事情的問題…我似乎記得最初在那個北约-条约平衡問題上，戴夫·安德烈開始了，我們真的明白了，他們對平衡的看法比我們在《蘇聯軍事實力》中所說的要悲觀得多，你知道的，關於這整個故事有很多不滿的人，儘管我認為這被很好地記錄了。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- 問題3：你是對的。

--- 段落 197 (436 字元) ---
There were some very specific technical aspects of the strategic  nuclear balance where it was just clear that the Soviets analyzed damage probabilities in a completely different way than we did.- Marshall: Right.- Q3: In ways which sometimes made us look better.[gap for tape change]  
- Q5: It was difficult to get almost anything out of you on subjects like “what do you  think about the Soviet defense burden” back in ‘83, ‘84, ‘85.

[翻譯]
在戰略核平衡的某些非常具體的技術層面上，很明顯蘇聯對損害機率的分析方式與我們完全不同。- 馬歇爾：對。- Q3：有時候這讓我們看起來更好。[停頓換帶] - Q5：在83年、84年、85年時，很難從你那裡得到任何關於像“你認為蘇聯的國防負擔如何”之類的信息。

--- 段落 198 (472 字元) ---
I just say that in the  sense that you’re much more open about this stuff the last few years, it seems to  me—  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q5: —than you ever were.And that, I think, has some consequences, from your  standpoint, for how clear messages maybe were communicated, even within the  office.Now, I assume you were completely forthcoming in private discussions,  you know, in appropriate…  
- Q2: When did the German talks start?- Marshall: They started back in the ‘70s.

[翻譯]
我只是說，就我看來，你在這些方面在過去幾年裡更加開放，似乎比以往任何時候都更開放。
- Marshall: 是的。- Q5: 而且我認為，從你的角度來看，這可能對於信息傳達的清晰性有一些後果，甚至在辦公室內部也是如此。現在，我假設在私下討論中，你是完全坦誠的，你知道，在適當的情況下…
- Q2: 德國談判是在什麼時候開始的？- Marshall: 它們始於70年代。

--- 段落 199 (482 字元) ---
They were the first ones we started.Mainly  because this group was headed by this General [von Orr/von Knorr?]…who was  a close friend of Peter Haas [Deputy Director for Science and Technology, Defense  Nuclear Agency] and had come to me.So they started, I think, probably around  ‘77, ‘78, something in there.The first actual meeting, I forget, whether it took place  here or there.And they did some interesting things for that.And then the French  thing, as I say, started in ‘81.

[翻譯]
這是我們開始的第一個小組。主要是因為這個小組由這位將軍[von Orr/von Knorr?]領導......他是彼得·哈斯[國防核能機構科技副總監]的親密朋友，而他又來找我。所以，他們應該是從‘77年，‘78年左右開始的。第一次實際會議，我忘記了是在這裡或那裡舉行的。他們對此做了一些有趣的事情。然後，就像我說的，法國的事情是在‘81年開始的。
