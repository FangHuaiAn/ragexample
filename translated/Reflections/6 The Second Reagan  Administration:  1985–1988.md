Presidents Reagan’s second term manifested significant continuity with the first term.Nuclear and conventional force modernization continued, as did research into strategic defense.Congressional efforts to dampen inter-service rivalry in the Defense Department seized on the idea of strengthening the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff in the Goldwater-Nichols DoD Reorganization Act of 1986.

[翻譯]
里根總統的第二個任期與第一個任期有顯著的延續性。核武器和常規軍力現代化繼續進行，戰略防禦研究也在繼續進行。為了減輕國防部內部軍種間的競爭，國會致力於加強聯合參謀長和聯合參謀會議，這一想法體現在1986年的戈德沃特-尼科爾斯國防部重組法案中。

--- 段落 3 (98 字元) ---
One of the new responsibilities for the Chairman was to produce an annual military net assessment.

[翻譯]
主席的一項新責任是製作一份年度軍事淨評估報告。

In the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev’s ascent to the leadership in 1985 produced a major shift in Soviet domestic and foreign policy.He cut military spending to free  up resources to invest in the economy and promoted the concepts of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) in a futile effort to save the Soviet Union  from economic and political collapse.

[翻譯]
在蘇聯，1985年米哈伊爾·戈爾巴喬夫登上領導地位，對蘇聯的國內和外交政策產生了重大轉變。他削減了軍事支出以資源用於經濟投資，並在挽救蘇聯免於經濟和政治崩潰的徒勞努力中推動了公開和重建的概念。

--- 段落 5 (350 字元) ---
In an effort to maintain some sort of parity  with the United States while cutting defense spending, Gorbachev agreed to  negotiations on two classes of nuclear weapons, resulting in two arms controls treaties with the United States—the 1987 Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF)  treaty and the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions Talks (START) treaty.

[翻譯]
為了在削減國防開支的同時與美國保持某種程度的平衡，戈爾巴喬夫同意就兩類核武器進行談判，與美國達成了兩項軍備控制條約—1987年中程核力量條約（INF條約）和1991年戰略武器削減談判（START條約）。

--- 段落 6 (171 字元) ---
Soviet armed intervention in Afghanistan continued until 1989 when Gorbachev finally withdrew the Red Army without having achieved the Soviet Union’s strategic objectives.

[翻譯]
蘇聯在阿富汗的武裝干預一直持續到1989年，戈爾巴喬夫最終撤出紅軍，並未實現蘇聯的戰略目標。

--- 段落 7 (349 字元) ---
Meanwhile, the Soviet Union itself began to dissolve slowly, starting with violence in the Baltic Republics and continuing through the Caucasus and Central Asian Republics.The United States continued to support evolving East European freedom  movements (particularly in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary) with public statements and covert funding.

[翻譯]
與此同時，蘇聯自身也開始慢慢解體，從波羅的海共和國爆發暴力事件開始，持續到高加索和中亞共和國。美國繼續以公開聲明和秘密資助支持不斷發展的東歐自由運動（尤其是在波蘭、捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利）。

--- 段落 8 (290 字元) ---
Unlike Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, the Soviet leadership decided not suppress these movements with the Red Army, nor those in the Republics of the Soviet Union.Eventually those countries and republics won their freedom and the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact collapsed in 1991.

[翻譯]
不同於1956年的匈牙利和1968年的捷克斯洛伐克，蘇聯領導層決定不用紅軍鎮壓這些運動，也不用鎮壓蘇聯共和國的運動。最終那些國家和共和國贏得了他們的自由，蘇聯和華沙條約組織於1991年崩潰。

In China, Deng Xiaoping continued to focus inwards. He maintained his efforts  to reform the economy and the nation’s industry while also downsizing and  modernizing China’s armed forces and rooting out corruption in the senior officer  ranks. He negotiated the return of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom and the  return of Macau from Portugal, demonstrating to the Chinese people and the  world that the expansion of China could be peaceful.

[翻譯]
在中國，鄧小平繼續專注內部事務。他一直努力改革經濟和國家產業，同時縮小和現代化中國的武裝力量，並清除高級軍官階層中的貪污問題。他成功與英國談判將香港歸還給中國，並與葡萄牙談判將澳門歸還給中國，向中國人民和世界展示中國的擴張是可以和平進行的。

- Marshall: The idea is to talk about the period ‘85 through the end of ‘88. As I thought  about that time period—I didn’t make a lot of detailed notes—I thought I’d talk  about assessments, about competitive strategies, about the Fred Iklé-Albert  Wohlstetter effort [the Commission on Integrated Long-Term Strategy], about  the—actually it preceded it [CILTS]—the nuclear strategy effort that Iklé [Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy] wanted…

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：這個想法是談論從85年到88年末的時期。當我考慮那段時間，我沒有記下很多詳細的筆記，我想談論評估、競爭策略、弗雷德·艾克勒-艾伯特·沃斯泰特的努力（整合長期戰略委員會），實際上是它先行 [CILTS]，艾克勒（國防部政策次長）想要的核戰略努力...

--- 段落 21 (452 字元) ---
- Q2: NSDG [Nuclear Strategy Development Group]  
- Marshall: …NSDG, yeah, and about the USSR endgame kind of things.Maybe there  are other topics that occur to you guys.- Q2: I’ll throw one out and you can throw it away.- Marshall: Yeah?- Q2: Packard Commission [President’s Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management], Goldwater-Nichols [Defense Reorganization Act of 1986], NSDD [National  Security Decision Directive] 219…  
- Marshall: Oh, yeah.

[翻譯]
- Q2：NSDG [核戰略發展組]  
- Marshall：…NSDG，對，還有蘇聯的結局之類的事情。也許你們有其他想到的主題。- Q2：我提出一個，你可以拋棄它。- Marshall：是嗎？- Q2：帕卡德委員會 [總統的國防管理藍帶委員會]，戈德沃特-尼克爾斯 [1986年國防重組法案]，NSDD [國家安全決策指令]219…  
- Marshall：哦，對。

--- 段落 22 (490 字元) ---
- Q2: The whole nonsense about the [Joint Chiefs of Staff] doing net assessments and  the Net Assessment Coordinating Committee and…  
- Marshall: Yeah, we ought to talk about that.[Adds topic to his outline.] OK, that’s a  good addition.On the assessment side, the only assessment I really have much memory of as  being a big thing, really, is the NATO-Warsaw Pact one.Now, we continued also  with the Investment Balances during that period, but we’ll take them up under  the USSR endgame.

[翻譯]
- 問題2： 關於聯合參謀會進行網絡評估以及網絡評估協調委員會的種種胡說八道...
- 馬歇爾：是的，我們應該談談這個。[將該話題加入大綱。]好的，這是一個很好的補充。就評估方面而言，我真正記憶深刻的唯一一個重要評估，就是關於北約和華沙條約組織的評估。此外，在那段時間我們也繼續進行投資平衡的工作，但我們將把它們放在蘇聯的結局討論中。

--- 段落 23 (358 字元) ---
I can’t think of any other really major assessment that got  done during that period.- Q2: There was one that George Kraus did on space that was not really a net assessment… Well, it was a net assessment, but it wasn’t a future net assessment so  much as kind of a current thing.And as I recall, the NRO [National Reconnaissance  Office]—  
- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
這段時期我想不起有其他重要的評估工作。- 有一個是喬治·克劳斯對太空進行的評估，不完全是一項綜合評估…… 嗯，它是一項綜合評估，但不是對未來的綜合評估，而更像是一件當前的事情。我記得美國國家偵察辦公室（NRO） - 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 24 (428 字元) ---
- 
- Q2: —so much disliked the results that they confiscated all copies and asked that it  not be distributed further and that sort of thing…  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: —And I think the guy that did that was General Thomas Moorman.- Marshall: Well, there was something that wasn’t really our assessment.It was an  assessment that was done jointly with somebody on the Joint Staff.And, yes, the  NRO didn’t really like the outcome.

[翻譯]
- 
- Q2：他們非常不喜歡這個結果，所以沒收了所有副本，要求不要再進行分發之類的事情...
- 馬歇爾：是的。
- Q2：我想據說那個做這件事的人是托馬斯·穆爾曼將軍。
- 馬歇爾：嗯，這個並不是我們的評估。這是與聯合參謀部的某人共同進行的評估。是的，國家侦察局並不真的喜歡這個結果。

--- 段落 25 (420 字元) ---
It was one of these things which was asked for  by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, I think.It was requested.And we have  copies around.It was conducted as a joint activity with a variety of people, various representatives.It turned out to be an assessment which, even though the  NRO didn’t like it, was, by my judgment, extremely bland, because it was a consensus sort of thing and nobody got particularly hurt.

[翻譯]
這是國防部長卡斯帕·溫伯格要求的事情之一，我認為是這樣。這是一項要求。我們有副本。這是與各種人一起進行的聯合活動，各種代表。結果證明它是一項評估，儘管美國國家偵察局不喜歡它，但根據我的判斷，這是非常平淡的，因為這是一個共識形式的事情，沒有人受到特別傷害。

--- 段落 26 (370 字元) ---
The one thing I remember  about it is a recommendation that a bad decision had been made to rely entirely  on the Shuttle and that Defense needed to really get back in the business of  putting stuff up with boosters.- Q5: You don’t suppose the “soda straw” sensor business came up?You know, [did]  that set of decisions come up?- Marshall: No, not particularly, I think.

[翻譯]
我記得的一件事是有一個建議，認為完全依賴太空梭是一個糟糕的決定，國防部需要真正重返使用助推器發射物資的業務。Q5：你不覺得“蘇打吸管”感應器的業務有提及嗎？你知道，那一系列的決定有提及嗎？Marshall：不，我不覺得特別是。

--- 段落 27 (405 字元) ---
- Q2: There was one other initiative that was not really a net assessment, but it was  this Interagency Technology Assessment Group.Do you remember that, the ITAG?- Marshall: Yeah.Q2: And you had some people over in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition that were going to help.And I think maybe Ronald St.Martin was  over there doing it for a while, then Jerry Murphy or somebody.

[翻譯]
Q2: 還有一個不完全是淨評估的倡議，那就是這個跨機構技術評估小組。你還記得這個ITAG嗎？- 馬歇爾：記得。Q2: 你在國防採購副部長辦公室有一些人在幫忙。我想也許羅納德·聖馬丁曾在那裡做過一段時間，然後是傑瑞·墨菲或其他人。

--- 段落 28 (483 字元) ---
And we tried to have  this interagency group looking at what really key and critical technologies might  look like, with this army colonel named Jack Wood, I think, running the thing…  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: …out of Acquisition or something.The only reason I mention that is because  we participated in the thing.You didn’t lead it, but it sticks in the back of my mind  that it was related in some way to net technical assessments that you were trying  to get off the ground again.

[翻譯]
我們試圖讓這個跨部門組織研究什麼是真正關鍵和關鍵的技術，有一位名叫傑克伍德的陸軍上校負責組織…  
- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：…從採購部門之類的地方運作。我提到這件事的唯一原因是因為我們參與了其中。你並不是這個項目的帶領者，但我仍記得這與你試圖再次啟動的網絡技術評估有關聯。

--- 段落 29 (345 字元) ---
Nobody had really done one since Paul Berenson  many years ago.And I think you actually tried to get, I think it was St.Martin, and  then maybe Jerry…  
- Marshall: Well, St.Martin was over there.I think that comes later, though.I think it’s  maybe… You don’t think so?- Q2: I don’t think so, because I wasn’t here after ‘88…  
- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
其實自保羅·貝倫森多年前以來沒有真正做過這件事。我想你確實試圖去找，我想那是聖馬丁，然後或許傑瑞…

- 馬歇爾：嗯，聖馬丁在那邊。我想那是後來的事情了。我覺得可能是… 你不這麼想嗎？

- Q2：我想不是，因為我在88年之後不在這兒了…

- 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 30 (475 字元) ---
- Q2: …and that was going on, at least the ITAG…  
- Marshall: The ITAG thing was going on, but there was an effort to really get things  going again in the early part of the Bush period when Admiral Bill Small came on,  and I think that’s when St.Martin was there.- Q2: Okay.Alright.- Marshall: But even then, because… I don’t know, the timing of all that’s unclear to  me.- Q2: OK.- Q4: Going back up to your original menu, when does Newport start?- Q2: The Summer Studies.

[翻譯]
- Q2：...至少ITAG 正在進行...
- 馬歇爾：ITAG 的事情正在進行，但在小布什時期初期，當比爾·斯莫爾上將出任時，確實有一個努力使事情重新啟動，我想那時候聖馬丁在那裡。- Q2：好的，沒問題。
- 馬歇爾：但即使如此，因為... 我不知道，所有這些的時間，對我來說都不清楚。- Q2：好的。- Q4：回到你最初的菜單，紐波特是什麼時候開始的？
- Q2：暑期研究。

--- 段落 31 (375 字元) ---
- Marshall: The first one is in LA, I think it was ‘85.And then in Newport in ‘86.- Q4: I think that ought to be something on your agenda.It certainly is a very sizable  chunk of time.- Marshall: OK, we can talk about that.Right.Let me say one word more on the  assessment side about the NATO-Warsaw Pact balance, which ended up being, I  think, a very successful assessment.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：第一次是在洛杉磯，我想是在1985年。然後在1986年在新港。

- Q4：我認為這應該是你議程上的一個重要議題。這確實是一段相當長的時間。

- 馬歇爾：好的，我們可以討論這個。對了。讓我在評估方面再談一下有關北約-華沙條約的平衡，我認為這是一個非常成功的評估。

--- 段落 32 (223 字元) ---
3 It also was the framework within which, because things had matured, we were able to incorporate a lot more on the Soviet  assessment stuff, the stuff that people had been doing and John Hines finally  brought to fruition.

[翻譯]
同時，這也是一個框架，使我們能夠在上述事情成熟後，將蘇聯評估相關的許多東西納入其中，這些是人們一直在做的，約翰·海恩斯最終實現了這些內容。

--- 段落 33 (479 字元) ---
And even after that—again, I don’t know the date; maybe either towards the end of this period or the early Bush period, because I can’t quite  remember, again, when Hines finally left—  
- Q2: He left before this, because we got Ned Cabaniss in, and Ned was trying to do  that Middle East assessment.So John left.He went over to the Army Intelligence  Board.- Marshall: Yeah.But he did one very, very useful thing at the end, although Dmitry  Ponomareff sort of had to finish it.

[翻譯]
即使在那之後 - 再次，我不知道日期；也許是在這段時期的末尾或布什早期，因為我不太記得，當 John Hines 最終離開的時候 -  
- Q2: 他在這之前就離開了，因為我們得到了 Ned Cabaniss，而 Ned 正在試圖進行中東評估。所以 John 離開了。他去了陸軍情報局。- 馬歇爾：是的。但最後他做了一件非常有用的事情，儘管德米特里·波諾馬列夫最終完成了這件事。

--- 段落 34 (295 字元) ---
He went down and tried to catalog all of the  ways in which Soviet assessments might really be different than ours, in particular,  some of these very surprising things, things that you would think objectively people could measure and so on, but they obviously had very, very different views of.

[翻譯]
他下去試圖整理蘇聯評估可能與我們真正不同的方式，尤其是一些非常令人驚訝的事情，你會認為客觀上人們可以衡量等等，但顯然他們對此有非常非常不同的看法。

--- 段落 35 (310 字元) ---
One of them was in terms of the size of the craters that nuclear weapons make  and how the explosive energy and blast wave energy from a nuclear explosion  couples to the ground and so on, which leads to very, very different expectations  on their part about the vulnerability of silos and things of that sort.

[翻譯]
其中之一是關於核武器造成的彈坑大小以及核爆炸的爆炸能量和衝擊波能量如何與地面結合，這導致他們對地下設施的易受性有非常不同的期望。

--- 段落 36 (410 字元) ---
The second one that struck me was just the very different estimate or belief in the  vulnerability of human beings to at least the kind of overpressure regimes that  are associated with fuel-air explosives, and may explain why they continued to go  ahead with these weapons in a way that we did not.They just see them as much  more lethal, and to this day one doesn’t know whether they’re right or we’re right.

[翻譯]
第二個打動我的是對人類對某種壓力過大所產生的脆弱性的估計或信念，這種壓力通常與燃料空氣炸彈有關，這也許可以解釋為什麼他們繼續使用這些武器，而我們則沒有。他們認為這些武器更致命，至今我們仍然不知道他們是否正確或我們是否正確。

--- 段落 37 (338 字元) ---
Anyway, that is still a very highly classified document, but it was a really very interesting piece to just show all the ways in which their calculations and assessments  might be very different than ours.And some of the stuff that’s come out in his  [Hines] interviews with the Russians is like that, including the ramifications of that.

[翻譯]
無論如何，那仍然是一份非常高度機密的文件，但這確實是一份非常有趣的文件，展示了他們的計算和評估方式可能與我們的非常不同的所有方式。他在對俄羅斯人的訪談中提到的一些信息也是如此，包括其中的一些衍生影響。

--- 段落 38 (281 字元) ---
I guess the most striking story in that connection is that at least some of the  Russians you talk to make the point that…which I think is a really very, very  interesting one…The more general aspect is that whatever you’re doing, you’re  communicating something to the other side.

[翻譯]
我想在這方面最引人注目的故事是，至少有一些你談話的俄羅斯人強調...我認為這真的非常非常有趣...更一般的一個方面是，無論你在做什麼，你都在向對方傳達一些訊息。

--- 段落 39 (464 字元) ---
And because of the spacing that  we chose for the Minuteman silos, supposedly wide enough apart that, under  our belief you couldn’t get “two with one” by putting a warhead in between, in  their way of calculating, that wasn’t true.Therefore, whatever we said, whatever  we did in exercises, they always believed the Minuteman missiles were first-strike  weapons [because they couldn’t survive a Soviet first-strike, so the U.S.would use  them first or lose them].

[翻譯]
由於我們為民兵地下發射井選擇的間隔過大，據說間隔寬得足夠這樣，根據我們的信仰，你無法通過將彈頭放在中間而獲得「一箭雙雕」，但根據他們的計算方式，這不是真的。因此，無論我們說什麼，無論我們在演習中做什麼，他們總是認為民兵導彈是先發制人的武器（因為它們無法抵禦蘇聯的先發制人攻擊，所以美國會先使用它們或失去它們）。

--- 段落 40 (475 字元) ---
- Q4: Have they subsequently confirmed that?Have we been able to talk to them  since the Berlin Wall came down that, indeed, that was something of a root difference in perceptions?- Marshall: I don’t know that anyone has probed it at the level of, you know, “Let’s  compare calculations” and so on, but it certainly comes out in some of John  Hines’ interviews with these Russians.They certainly believed that ground-based  systems were much more vulnerable than we believed.

[翻譯]
問題4：他們後來有確認嗎？自柏林圍牆倒塌以來，我們是否已經能夠與他們交談，確實地這是一種根本上的觀念差異？

馬歇爾：我不知道有人是否在探討到這個層次，“讓我們比較一下計算”之類的事情，但在約翰·海恩斯對這些俄羅斯人的一些訪問中，這肯定是有所體現的。他們確實相信地面系統比我們所相信的更容易受到攻擊。

--- 段落 41 (481 字元) ---
- Q2: There was another area that I remember that was not quite as important, but, I  think, exemplifies this whole thing, and that we got hold of some of their numbers for conventional systems.And they ranked the M60A2 tank very, very high.M60A2, that’s the Shillelagh missile one.And we thought, of course, it was a dog,  it wasn’t worth a damn, and we stopped building them.Well, by their measures,  you know, tanks that shot missiles through the tube were very, very effective.

[翻譯]
Q2：我記得還有另一個領域並不是非常重要，但我認為它代表了整個情況，我們掌握了一些他們常規系統的數據。他們將M60A2坦克排名極高。M60A2，那就是Shillelagh導彈。我們當時認為這是一個爛東西，一點價值也沒有，所以就停止建造。但是根據他們的衡量標準，將導彈射出的坦克是非常有效的。

--- 段落 42 (341 字元) ---
They were, I think, building on the lessons of the ‘73 Arab-Israeli war in terms of  the vulnerability of tanks to anti-tank guided missiles.And so they went down this  whole path of tanks; one series of the T-64, the T-72, the T-80—all have missile-firing main guns.We stopped it after the M60A2, because we just thought it was  such a dog.

[翻譯]
我認為他們是在借鏡1973年阿以戰爭的教訓，對坦克易受反坦克飛彈攻擊的脆弱性。因此，他們走上了開發擁有導彈發射主砲的坦克的道路；T-64、T-72、T-80等一系列坦克都擁有導彈發射主砲。但我們在M60A2之後停止了這一條路，因為我們認為它實在太差了。

--- 段落 43 (458 字元) ---
Again, an asymmetric view of kind of the—in this case, more the technical than tactical characteristics of the system really led to very different kinds  of weapon systems.And different views of their effectiveness on the battlefield.So when they’re looking at what the correlation of forces are at a particular point  they see, “Ah, M60A2s.Must be main attack” and we say, “M60A2s.National Guard.Got the dogs.”  
- Q4: All 65 of them, or some modest number.

[翻譯]
再次，對系統的技術特性的不對稱觀點確實導致了非常不同種類的武器系統，更偏向技術而非戰術特徵。對戰場上的效力有不同的看法。因此，當他們觀看特定點的力量對比時，他們看到說：“啊，M60A2應該是主要攻擊”，而我們說：“M60A2，國民警衛，那些都是菜鳥。”
- 問題四：所有65台，還是一些較小的數量？

--- 段落 44 (471 字元) ---
- Q2: And then we have the Sheridans, of course, have the same kind of thing.- Q3: There was some talk or effort to get people to look at Soviet helicopters that  had been shot down in Afghanistan, to see if we could get some insights into the  differences in their design practices.Did that ever come through?- Marshall: I don’t know.Right.OK, let’s go on to item two, competitive strategies.- Q2: Can I say one more thing on the NATO-Warsaw Pact thing?- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
Q2：當然，接著我們有謝里登一家，也有同樣的事情。
Q3：關於蘇聯直升機在阿富汗被擊落後，有一些討論或努力希望讓人們能夠瞭解它們的設計差異。這個計劃有成功嗎？
Marshall：我不知道。好的，讓我們繼續談第二項，競爭策略。
Q2：我可以再談一件有關北約-華沙條約組織的事情嗎？
Marshall：當然。

--- 段落 45 (483 字元) ---
- Q2: I think that was the first place where this concept of the “revolution in military  affairs” [RMA] was introduced in a formal assessment.Because we…  
- Marshall: That’s probably true.- Q2: I know we introduced it in that assessment.I think it was the first assessment  that introduced that notion.- Marshall: Well, of the assessments.It had first come up in connection with the CILTS  stuff.But in terms of what we were including in one of the assessments, yes, that’s  right.

[翻譯]
問2：我覺得這可能是第一次在正式評估中引入“軍事革命”概念的地方。因為我們...
馬歇爾：這可能是真的。
問2：我知道我們在那次評估中引入了這個概念。我認為這是第一次引入這個概念的評估。
馬歇爾：嗯，在評估中。這個概念最初是與CILTS相關的。但就我們在其中一次評估中包含的東西來看，沒錯。

--- 段落 46 (348 字元) ---
- Q2: And then we also got some Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov stuff, and not just the open  stuff like Always in Defense of the Homeland [Always in Readiness to Defend the  Fatherland, 1982], but we had some human intelligence that was giving us stuff  that, you know, really indicated that this was very, very important to the Soviets.- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
Q2：然後我們也得到了一些尼古拉·奧加科夫元帥的情報，不僅是像《永遠捍衛祖國》（1982年）這樣公開的情報，還有一些人員情報給了我們一些線索，真的表明這對蘇聯非常重要。- 尼古拉·奧加科夫元帥：是的。

--- 段落 47 (511 字元) ---
- Q2: And we briefed Major General John Shalikashvili, who was the Assistant DCSOPS  [Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans] in the Army at the time, on this  thing, as well as Major General Wilson [Dutch] Shoffner, who was his predecessor,  on this particular thing, and both of them were very, very knowledgeable of that  particular source of intelligence that was confirming this view that Ogarkov and  the Soviet General Staff had about how there was going to be this revolution in  warfare coming.

[翻譯]
Q2：我們向畣時在陸軍擔任副參謀長（作戰和計劃）的約翰·沙利卡許利少將以及他的前任威爾遜·沙夫納少將簡要介紹了這個事情，他們對確認奧加爾科夫和蘇聯總參謀部對於即將到來的戰爭革命的這個觀點非常了解。

--- 段落 48 (261 字元) ---
I guess the other thing I would say is that caused the net assessment to get a fairly  wide distribution.Well, we did two versions.We had the codeword version, and  then we did a Secret version, and the Secret version got a wider distribution.- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
我猜我還要說的另一件事是導致網路評估獲得相當廣泛分佈。嗯，我們做了兩個版本。我們有代號版本，然後我們做了一個機密版本，機密版本獲得了更廣泛的分發。- 馬歇爾：沒錯。

- Q2: It was probably one of the first efforts by the office to have this RMA concept  in it that then went out to people in the Department and said, “Here’s something  you ought to be looking at, because this is something the Soviets are taking very  seriously.”  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q5: There’s sort of one other tidbit about this.

[翻譯]
Q2：這可能是辦公室首次採納風險評估管理（RMA）概念的努力，然後將其傳達給部門內的人，並說：“你們應該關注這個，因為蘇聯人非常重視這一點。”
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q5：關於這個，還有一些其他小訊息。

--- 段落 50 (359 字元) ---
Earlier you and David Epstein were  going off and worrying about the defense burden over there [in the Soviet  Union], and it hadn’t gotten connected into the balance in the way that it probably should have at that time—  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q5: —if we’d been able to think the thing through a little more clearly.Did that  occur further downstream?- Q2: Yes.

[翻譯]
早些時候，你和大衛·愛普斯坦一直在擔心蘇聯那邊的防禦負擔，但當時這種負擔並沒有以應有的方式連接到平衡中——
- 馬歇爾：是的。- 問題5：如果我們當時能更清晰地思考這件事，這種情況是否在之後進一步發生？
- 問題2：是的。

--- 段落 51 (407 字元) ---
In fact, the third section of the balance looked really at… You know, the  first section was deterrence and how do the Soviets assess the balance.And  the second section was, “What if deterrence fails?What do we think likely war  outcomes might be?” And then a third section was, “What do we think is coming  in the future?”  And here is where we introduced the RMA, the Soviet view that this RMA is coming.

[翻譯]
事實上，平衡的第三部分看起來確實很……你知道，第一部分是威懾力量以及蘇聯是如何評估平衡的。第二部分是，“如果威懾失效會發生什麼？我們認為戰爭結果可能是什麼？”第三部分是，“我們認為未來將會發生什麼？”在這裡，我們介紹了RMA，蘇聯認為這個RMA即將到來。

--- 段落 52 (331 字元) ---
But also this notion that there’s this increasing pessimism on their part that  they’re able to compete with us.They see that this RMA with the kinds of hightech things that are associated with it, because they were really focusing on it as a  technology kind of thing, like weapons based on new physical principles, and so  forth.

[翻譯]
但他們也有逐漸增加的悲觀情緒，認為他們無法和我們競爭。他們看到這個革命性軍事變革伴隨著與之相關的高科技事物，因為他們真的把它視為一種技術性的東西，例如基於新物理原則的武器等。

--- 段落 53 (331 字元) ---
They were just very pessimistic that they were going to have the resource  base, in its broadest sense [indistinct] S&T [scientific and technical] base [indistinct] that they were going to be able to compete with us.And I think that some  of that is what came out of David Epstein’s work on the investment balance.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
他們只是非常悲觀地認為他們將擁有資源基礎，從廣義上來看，科學技術基礎，他們將能夠與我們競爭。我認為一些由大衛·艾普斯坦在投資平衡中所做的工作得出了這一結論。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 54 (416 字元) ---
And putting the two things together, it ended up with— And I  remember raising an issue for the top-level people that, “You really ought to be  thinking about how to invest in this stuff and to really take advantage of the…”  
- Q2: We specifically and explicitly also raised the competitive strategies notion—  
- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q2: —in this context.You know, looking to the future, what should we be doing?

[翻譯]
將這兩件事情放在一起，結果就是——我記得對高層人員提出了一個問題，“你們真的應該考慮如何投資這些東西，並真正利用…”  
- Q2: 我們也專門和明確地提出了競爭策略的概念——  
- Marshall: 是的，沒錯。- Q2: —在這個情況下。你知道，展望未來，我們應該做些什麼？

--- 段落 55 (471 字元) ---
And we specifically said, “Well, we ought to think about competing with the  Soviets in this competitive strategies framework, where they’re having a very  difficult time making the kinds of investments that they need to stay up with us,  and we need to target our investments in such a way that it’s just going to make  it just that much more difficult for them, and get them to focus in areas that are  not particularly dangerous to us, like defense instead of offense.

[翻譯]
我們明確表示：“我們應該考慮在這個競爭策略框架中與蘇聯競爭，他們很難進行所需的投資以跟上我們，我們需要以一種方式來針對我們的投資，讓他們更難抗衡，並讓他們專注於對我們來說不是特別危險的領域，如防禦而不是進攻。"

--- 段落 56 (320 字元) ---
” So we were able  to— Part of that is sort of the serendipity of taking many, many years and many,  many authors to put this balance together.- Marshall: Right.OK, let’s go on to the competitive strategies thing.As I mentioned  last time, in some ways that story starts a long time ago, back at RAND.4 That was  in ‘69.

[翻譯]
所以我們能夠 - 其中一部分是花費許多年和許多作者來達成這種平衡的幸運巧合。- 馬歇爾：對，我們現在來談競爭策略這件事。如我上次提到的，這個故事在很久以前就開始了，那是在RAND。那是在1969年。

5 And then, in the first year of the Reagan Administration, when the time  came to put together the policy guidance [Defense Guidance], Iklé asked me to  look at the draft and then asked me whether there was anything additional that  could be put in it.

[翻譯]
在裡根政府的第一年，當時該制定政策指南（國防指引）時，伊克勒請我看了草案，然後問我是否還有其他可以補充的地方。

--- 段落 58 (362 字元) ---
And I raised the point that there could be a section that tried to  focus people’s attention on the notion that in thinking about their programs they  ought to be taking account of what the impact on the other guy was, and, in particular, cost-imposing strategies.So he asked me to write a section, which he put  in there.6 And then essentially nothing happened.

[翻譯]
我提出了這一點，認為可以設立一個部分，試圖引導人們專注於這樣一個觀念：在思考他們的計劃時，他們應該考慮到對另一方的影響，特別是造成成本的策略。於是他要求我寫一個部分，然後把它放進去。然後基本上什麼也沒發生。

Even though, when Paul Thayer  came on board as Deputy Secretary of Defense, he looked at it, thought that was  a good idea, and a query was put out to the Services about, “What have you done  about this?” and various levels of nonsense came back.

[翻譯]
即使在保羅·塞耶擔任美國國防部副部長時，他認為這是一個好主意，向各軍種提出了一個查詢：“你們對此做了什麼？”然而，收到的回應卻是各種程度的無稽之談。

7  But then, what really happened was that in the second Reagan Administration,  Weinberger asked Graham Allison [Dean, Harvard Kennedy School of Government] to come down and help him, come down a couple of days a week, I think  it was, something like that.

[翻譯]
然而，實際上發生的事情是，在第二屆里根政府中，魏恩伯格請格雷厄姆·艾里森（哈佛大學肯尼迪政府學院院長）前來幫忙，好像每週來幾天。

--- 段落 61 (308 字元) ---
And one of the first things that Graham and I talked  about was that Weinberger wanted Graham, for one thing, to write the next  posture statement, and also wanted to cure this problem of these charges that  Reagan Administration defense officials don’t have a strategy and so on, and  how should we do this.

[翻譯]
格雷厄姆和我談論的第一件事之一是，韋恩伯格想讓格雷厄姆寫下一份新的姿勢聲明，並且希望解決一個問題，即里根政府的國防官員沒有戰略等指控，該如何解決這個問題。

--- 段落 62 (438 字元) ---
As I mentioned the last time, I’d already had a session and  wrote a number of things to Frank Carlucci [Deputy Secretary of Defense] in the  first year of the first Reagan term, but nothing came of that either.That work dealt  with what you might do to really develop a strategy or have a strategy or what  would that all mean.Because of Graham, we talked about it and one of the ideas  was… the label picked was “competitive strategies.

[翻譯]
正如我上次提到的那樣，在里根首次任期的第一年，我已經開展了一次會議，並給美國國防副部長法蘭克·卡盧奇寫了許多東西，但也沒有什麼結果。那份工作涉及到你可能要如何真正發展戰略，或者擁有戰略，又或者這一切意味著什麼。由於格雷厄姆，我們談論了這個問題，其中一個想法是……所選的標籤是“競爭策略”。

--- 段落 63 (408 字元) ---
” He talked to Weinberger, and  even though it was something that had been really suggested before, this time  he bought it, to my surprise.He bought it, at least in the sense that he was willing  to see the thing kind of go along.I don’t think he ever did very much one way  or another about any of it.But it got started and therefore we got involved with  Graham, helping him get that whole thing underway.

[翻譯]
他跟韋茲柏格談過，即使這個建議之前已經提出過，這次他竟然買賬了，讓我感到驚訝。至少在某種程度上，他買賬了，願意看這件事開展。我認為他對任何事情都沒有太多積極參與或否定。但事情開始了，因此我們也隨之被捲入幫助格雷厄姆啟動整個計劃。

--- 段落 64 (438 字元) ---
8 And then, both a good  thing and a bad thing, they picked Dennis Kloske [Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Planning and Resources] to be the one in charge.He was an energetic  person and he tried to push it.He kind of screwed it up, but it wasn’t like giving it  to somebody who didn’t do anything with it  He did all kinds of things with it.He was not bureaucratically very astute, and so  in the end it didn’t flourish very well.

[翻譯]
在這之後，他們選擇了丹尼斯·克洛斯克（國防部計劃和資源副部長）來負責這件事情，這既是好事也是壞事。他是一個充滿活力的人，他試圖推動這件事情。他有點搞砸了，但也不像把它交給一個無所作為的人。他做了各種各樣的事情。他在官僚層面並不很精明，所以最終這件事情並沒有很好的發展。

--- 段落 65 (412 字元) ---
Although after the fact, there were people who came to me, guys who were younger and guys who were involved in it in the  Services, and said, “That was a good idea.We ought to do things like that.” But at  the time it didn’t flourish.- Q2: One thing in that regard, is that the O-5s and O-6s that were on the task forces  were trying to figure what the strategies should be to make up this competitive  strategy.

[翻譯]
雖然事後有人來找我，一些年輕人和跟我一起參與的人說：“那是個好主意。我們應該做一些類似的事情。”但當時並沒有蓬勃發展。與此相關的一件事是，參與專案小組的O-5和O-6試圖找出應該採取怎樣的戰略來制定這個競爭策略。

--- 段落 66 (479 字元) ---
They were really trying to make this thing work, as opposed to other  efforts associated with the RMA, where people were, for bureaucratic reasons,  trying to “block that kick.” These guys were really trying to make the thing work.They were really analyzing things seriously and trying to figure stuff out.I’ve also  talked to a number of people who were on competitive strategy task forces at the  time that said it was one of the most broadening experiences that they ever had.

[翻譯]
他們真的在努力讓這件事成功，與與RMA相關的其他努力相反，當時人們因為官僚原因試圖“擋住這個進程”。這些人真的在努力讓事情成功。他們真的認真分析事情並試著找出解決方法。我也曾跟當時參與競爭策略專案小組的人交談過，他們說這是他們人生中最豐富的經驗之一。

--- 段落 67 (468 字元) ---
Really the first chance they ever had in their military career to do some strategic  thinking on something.They were sad that it just didn’t go anywhere.So at one  level, maybe it helped raise this notion for a group of officers that maybe now are  general officers, that there was a broader, larger way of thinking about what their  business really is, not just fighting the battle of the budget every week.- Q3: Can you think of any of the O-5s who are still around?

[翻譯]
這真的是他們在軍事生涯中第一次有機會對某事進行戰略思考。 他們很失望，因為這次機會未能落實。所以從某個層面來看，也許有助於一群可能現在是將軍的軍官意識到，他們對自己的業務有一種更廣泛、更大的思考方式，不僅僅是每週與預算鬥爭。- 問題3：你能想到那些O-5軍官中還在現場的人嗎？

--- 段落 68 (456 字元) ---
- Q2: Well, they wouldn’t be O-5s now.- Q3: No, I know.- Q2: One guy that just talked to me last week is Marty Spolarich, who is still up in  OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense].He was on the Navy Staff working  competitive strategies at the time.On the Army Staff was this guy Monty Meigs.He wasn’t one of the guys on the task force.He was an Army Staff guy watching  all this.And he’s now a general officer.He’s a brigadier or major general now.

[翻譯]
問2: 嗯，他們現在不會是O-5級。- 問3: 是的，我知道。- 問2: 上週剛和我交談過的一個人是馬蒂·斯波拉里奇（Marty Spolarich），他仍然在國防部（OSD）任職。他當時在海軍參謀部負責競爭戰略。在陸軍參謀部的則是蒙蒂·梅格斯（Monty Meigs）。他不是任務部隊的一員，而是一個監察所有情況的陸軍參謀。他現在是一名將軍，可能是一星或兩星將軍。

--- 段落 69 (424 字元) ---
And  he probably will be a three-star or a four-star someday [he retired as a four-star  general in 2002].So he’s at least been exposed to the “virus.” And again, he was  on the Army Staff, he wasn’t on a task force, so he didn’t get the intense exposure  that people on the task forces did.And there was an Air Force guy Mike Hayden.Mike Hayden was an Air Force colonel that worked competitive strategies on the  Air Staff.

[翻譯]
他可能將來會成為一名三星或四星將軍[他在2002年退役時是一名四星將軍]。所以他至少已經接觸過這個"病毒"了。而且他曾經在陸軍參謀部任職，他不是在一個特遣部隊，所以他並沒有像特遣部隊的人一樣受到強烈的接觸。還有一個美國空軍的人，麥克·海登（Mike Hayden）。麥克·海登是美國空軍上校，在空軍參謀部擔任競爭策略工作。

--- 段落 70 (328 字元) ---
And Mike is now a brigadier general, J-2 in European Command, and  in between there was on the National Security Council staff in the Bush White  House.[Michael Hayden retired as a four-star general and served as Director of  the National Security Agency and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.]  
- Marshall: Oh, yeah.

[翻譯]
麥克現在是歐洲司令部的J-2准將，在這之前曾在布希政府白宮的國家安全委員會工作。 [邁克爾·海登退役時是四星將軍，曾擔任國家安全局局長和中央情報局局長。]
- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 71 (488 字元) ---
- Q2: We were able to use him as a vehicle to get competitive strategies introduced  into a couple of the National Security Strategy [of the United States] documents,  because he thought it was a good idea and stuff.9 These are episodic things, but  there are still some people that are at general officer level, that were exposed to  this thing.Maybe someday they will come back to haunt everybody who was here.- Marshall: General Howell Estes, USAF, I think had something to do with it.

[翻譯]
Q2：我們能夠利用他作為一個工具，將競爭策略引入美國《國家安全戰略》文件中，因為他認為這是一個好主意。這些是臨時性的事情，但仍有一些高級軍官接觸到這件事。也許有一天他們會回來困擾所有當時在場的人。- 馬歇爾：美國空軍將領豪爾艾斯特斯將軍，我想他與此有關。

--- 段落 72 (363 字元) ---
Another  aspect of the competitive strategies effort, though, was the really, again, abysmal  performance of the intelligence people.They were told from the beginning, “If  we’re going to do this, we really need to know how the Soviets look at things,  think about things, and so on.” That message was repeated over and over again.And they never seemed to get it.

[翻譯]
競爭策略努力的另一個方面是情報人員的表現實在是糟糕透頂。從一開始就告訴他們："如果我們要這麼做，我們真的需要知道蘇聯人看待事情的方式，思考事情的方式等等。"這個訊息一再被重申，但他們似乎始終無法領會。

--- 段落 73 (477 字元) ---
And then, sort of midway through the thing, I  get feedback…I think there was a meeting with a bunch of them, and then it was  as though, “Ah!We finally got it!” And then they did a few things…10  Q4: There was a briefing on arms control.Competitive strategies and arms control.11  
- Marshall: Jim Roche did that.Q4: Barry Watts and Chip Pickett put it together and Jim gave it out in California.24  hours later it was sitting on the desk in the Secretary of Defense’s office.

[翻譯]
然後，在事情進行過程中，我收到反饋...我想他們開了一次會議，然後彷彿“啊！我們終於搞定了！” 然後他們做了一些事情...Q4：有一個有關軍備控制的簡報。競爭策略和軍備控制。 馬歇爾：吉姆·羅奇負責。Q4：巴里·沃茨和奇普·皮克特組織了這部分，吉姆在加利福尼亞發布了它。 24小時後，這份文件就擺放在國防部長的辦公室桌上。

--- 段落 74 (468 字元) ---
And as it  was recounted, he sort of looked at the definition that we put up and said, “Yeah,  that’s it.” And the study group served as a standing staff.I had a few windows into  what they were doing from time to time.But my impression is they went off and  said, “We’re going to make our own definition,” and six months later they were basically back to using the definition we had put together.We still have the charts.- Marshall: As I remember that meeting in L.A.

[翻譯]
而正如所述，他看了我們提出的定義，說：“是的，就是這樣。”而學習小組本身就像一個常設的工作人員。我偶爾能窺探到他們在做什麼。但我印象中，他們似乎決定走自己的路，並說：“我們會制定自己的定義，”六個月後他們基本上又回到了我們當初設立的定義。我們仍然保存著那些圖表。- 馬歇爾: 我還記得在洛杉磯的那次會議。

--- 段落 75 (424 字元) ---
, I talked some about the general  aspects of it.Then Jim had his thing.Then there was a third thing by somebody,  which was one of these things where you just take the label and attach it to whatever it is you are doing.12 So it was a whole list of things, which…  
- Q5: Yeah, it was the “everything we’ve always been doing” [indistinct] competitive  strategies [indistinct].- Marshall: Yes, right.Stick a new label on it.

[翻譯]
我稍微談了一些一般性的方面。然後吉姆說了他的想法。然後有一個第三個人提出的想法，就是一個你只需要拿標籤貼上你正在做的任何事情的情況。所以這是一長串的事情，這些事情…- Q5: 是的，這是"我們一直在做的一切"競爭策略[不清楚]。- 馬歇爾: 是的，沒錯。只是給它貼上一個新標籤。

--- 段落 76 (447 字元) ---
- Q2: That was the initial kind of reaction to the Weinberger [competitive strategy]  memos, when he said, “We’re going to have a meeting, we’re going to have this  group and I’m going to chair it, and come in and tell me what you guys are doing  that’s associated with or even looks like this competitive strategies.” The Navy  gets in there and says, “Here is our competitive strategy.It’s called the Maritime  Strategy.” And he says, “OK, fine.

[翻譯]
Q2: 這是對 Weinberger [競爭策略] 聯合策略的初步反應，當他說：“我們將舉行一次會議，我們會有這個小組，我會主持，進來告訴我你們正在做的與競爭戰略相關或看起來像競爭戰略的事情。” 海軍參與其中並說：“這是我們的競爭策略。它被稱為海上戰略。” 然後他說：“好的，沒問題。”

--- 段落 77 (475 字元) ---
” The Air Force stood up and said, “Here’s our  competitive strategy.These ten weapon systems here and technologies will allow  us to compete effectively with anybody around the world, anytime anyplace, it  doesn’t matter who it is.Those systems are our competitive strategies.” And then,  Army General Max Thurman [Army Vice Chief of Staff] got up and gave a very interesting special-access-program briefing on some stuff that the Army was doing.That was closer to the mark.

[翻譯]
空軍站起來說：“這是我們的競爭策略。這裡有這十個武器系統和技術，將使我們能夠有效地與全球任何人競爭，無論何時何地，無論對手是誰。這些系統就是我們的競爭策略。”然後，陸軍中將馬克斯·瑟曼（陸軍副參謀長）站起來，對陸軍正在進行的一些事情進行了一個非常有趣的特殊存取計畫簡報。這更接近事實。

--- 段落 78 (499 字元) ---
Obviously can’t go into it.But generally the Service  responses were—“We IS a competitive strategy.”  
- Marshall: I must say that the more senior military did not cover themselves with the  glory at all.General Colin Powell at some point said, “Well, we do this all the time.This is what we always do.” Bullshit!- Q2: Jeff McKitrick had to go personally and brief Admiral Carlisle Trost [Chief of  Naval Operations], because the Navy initially wasn’t even going to play—  
- Marshall: That’s right.

[翻譯]
顯然不能進一步討論。但一般來說，服務機構的回應是：“我們是一個競爭策略。”馬歇爾：我必須說，較資深的軍官們完全沒有表現出色。柯林·鮑威爾將軍曾經說過：“哦，我們這樣做一直都是常態。這是我們經常做的事情。”胡說八道！Q2：傑夫·麥基特里克不得不親自去向海軍作戰部長卡萊爾·特羅斯特提供簡報，因為最初海軍甚至不打算參與——馬歇爾：沒錯。

--- 段落 79 (496 字元) ---
Q2: —and Jaymie Durnan took McKitrick in to see Trost, because Trost wanted  to know “Who’s the troublemaker down there doing this stuff?” And so Jaymie,  said, “I think I should take McKitrick to see Trost.” So McKitrick went up there and  briefed him on what the initiative was and why and all that.And Trost said the  same thing.He said, “Look, we do this all the time.This is the way we do business.”
- Marshall: Well, the Navy had more of a complaint because of what they were really  doing.

[翻譯]
Q2: - 而傑米·德南（Jaymie Durnan）帶著麥基特里克（McKitrick）去見特洛斯（Trost），因為特洛斯想知道“在下面搞這些事情的麻煩製造者是誰？”。因此，傑米說：“我想應該讓麥基特里克去見特洛斯。”於是麥基特里克上去向他匯報了該倡議項目的具體內容及原因。特洛斯也說了同樣的話。他說：“看，我們一直都這樣做。這是我們的做事方式。”
- 馬歇爾（Marshall）：嗯，海軍更加抱怨，因為他們真正做的事情。

--- 段落 80 (409 字元) ---
There was an area where they were really doing it.- Q2: That’s right.[Indistinct]  
- Marshall: And the Air Force, in some people.Although I generally found that people who were by far more responsive were like Richard DeLauer [Under Secretary  of Defense for Research and Engineering].When that first guidance document  came out that I mentioned, he was very interested.Guys from business saw it  right away.

[翻譯]
有一個地方他們正在真正地做這件事。- Q2: 對的。- 馬歇爾：以及空軍，在一些人眼中。雖然我通常發現那些對這個問題有更積極反應的人像是理查德·德勞爾（國防部研究和工程副部長）。當我提到的那份首次指導文件出來時，他非常感興趣。商界的人馬上看到了其中的好處。

--- 段落 81 (428 字元) ---
In fact, he had some people do a quick-and-dirty analysis of, “What  is the cost of the Soviet air defense system and how can we do things that really  drive that up still further?”13 Or William Perry [DeLauer’s predecessor and Secretary  of Defense at the time of the interview].Guys like that just see it right away.But  the military guys, on the whole, do not, despite Colin Powell’s “We do this all the  time” kind of thing.

[翻譯]
事實上，他讓一些人對「蘇聯防空系統的成本是多少，我們如何做一些事情來進一步提高這個成本？」進行了快速而粗糙的分析。或者像威廉·佩里（德劳尔的前任，也是授訪時的國防部長）這樣的人。像他們這樣的人很快就能看透這一點。但整體而言，軍方人員並未意識到這一點，盡管柯林·鮑威爾說過「我們一直這樣做」。

--- 段落 82 (453 字元) ---
Maybe at a tactical level or operational level they do, but in  this investment sense, it is rare, very rare.Although…  
- Q5: At a tactical level?I can’t imagine what it would be.- Marshall: Well, you look at weaknesses.You look at exploiting weaknesses.- Q5: Yeah, you do try to put strength against weakness.- Marshall: Whereas most of the stuff that you see happen in the Building is characterized by countering new strengths that the other guy has.

[翻譯]
也許在戰術層面或操作層面上他們會這樣做，但在投資意義上，這是罕見的，非常罕見的。儘管...
-問題5：在戰術層面上？我無法想像那可能是什麼。
-馬歇爾：嗯，你要看弱點。你要利用弱點。
-問題5：是的，你確實會試圖用力量對抗弱點。
-馬歇爾：而在建築物中發生的大部分事情則是以對抗對方的新優勢為特徵。

--- 段落 83 (466 字元) ---
Q2: Or, more typically, done irrespective of what the other guy is doing.You know,  “We need a new year’s supply of ‘Y’.”  
- Q5: [Indistinct] the other ones are old.Tactically, trying to put your strengths against  their weakness, in sort of a generic sense, was seen as producing tactical success.Cost imposition, in a long-term sense, was not part of that.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: I think typically you don’t find at the tactical level this kind of series of moves.

[翻譯]
Q2: 或者更典型的是，不論對方做什麼都會執行。你知道，“我們需要一年份的'Y'。”
- Q5: [不清楚] 其他那幾個是老的。從戰術上看，嘗試將你的優勢對抗他們的弱點，在一種通用意義上，被視為產生戰術成功。成本施加，在長期意義上，不是其中的一部分。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2: 我想通常在戰術層面上你不會發現這種一連串的舉動。

--- 段落 84 (497 字元) ---
The, “I’m going to think about doing this—now, what might he do in response?So, what do I do then?What does that mean about my first move that I tried to  get him in a position…” Tactically, you don’t…  
- Q3: My understanding is that, in fact, some of the aspects of maneuver warfare do  have that.You act in a way so as to force him to react, which forces him to respond  in the way that you predict.- Q2: At the operational level, if you’re doing it right.And certainly at the strategic  level.

[翻譯]
我會考慮做這個──現在，他可能會做什麼回應呢？那我接下來應該怎麼辦？這意味著我第一步的行動試圖使他處於一個什麼樣的位置呢…”從戰術上來看，你不會…
- Q3：我認為，實際上，機動戰的一些方面確實有這種情況。你的行動會強迫他做出反應，這又迫使他按照你預測的方式回應。
- Q2：在運作層面上，如果你做得對。當然，在戰略層面上也是如此。

--- 段落 85 (493 字元) ---
But very seldom at the tactical level.You’re looking at single engagements  there, not…  
- Q3: Do you channelize the enemy when you force him to go to a certain way, but  you know [indistinct].The business I was thinking about [indistinct].I thought  commanders [indistinct].- Q2: Commander’s Estimate.- Q3: Yeah.- Q5: I don’t think they get much beyond the first step.- Q2: Yeah.- Q5: I would agree.Q2: That’s at the tactical level.At the operational level, you get some guys that are  good.

[翻譯]
但在戰術層面上很少見。在那裡，你看到的是單一的交戰，而不是...
- Q3：當你強迫敵人走向某個方向時，你是否將其引導？但你知道[無法辨認]。我在想的是[無法辨認]。我覺得指揮官[無法辨認]。
- Q2：指揮官的估計。
- Q3：是的。
- Q5：我認為他們很難超越第一步。
- Q2：是的。
- Q5：我同意。Q2：這是在戰術層面上。在作戰層面上，有一些人是很厲害的。

They will think about it as a series of moves and how they want to be positioned better at the end of the day or…  Q5: I don’t know, but I can’t remember any documentary or war story evidence from  the Gulf War of us getting to a second round of steps and counters in anything  that was done, in planning or executing that campaign.- Q2: Maybe through serendipity, with the Marines offshore.

[翻譯]
他們將把這看作一系列的舉措，以及他們在一天結束時希望如何更好地定位自己... Q5: 我不知道，但我記不起在海灣戰爭中有我們進行第二輪步驟和反擊的任何紀錄片或戰爭故事證據，無論是在計劃還是執行該戰役中。- Q2: 也許是通過偶然性，有了海岸警衛隊。

When it turned out that  they couldn’t land because of the mines, then we said, “Well, let’s make a virtue  out of a necessity and try to use them to hold forces down and then we would  come in from the other direction.”  
- Q5: But competitive strategies thinking is different than blind luck.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q4: [Indistinct] I wonder whether thinking second- or third-order sort of moves  isn’t actually fairly unusual, even in the business world.

[翻譯]
當他們因為地雷無法降落時，我們說，“好吧，讓我們以逆境為美，嘗試利用它們來壓制敵軍，然後我們將從另一個方向進攻。”
- Q5：但競爭策略思維不同於盲目的幸運。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q4：[不清楚] 我懷疑在商業世界中，思考第二或第三順序的策略是否實際上是相當不尋常的。

There was sort of a newsy  article on learning in the Times about two months ago.And one of the points  made was that even if you go look at experienced chess players, they don’t, in  fact, think “move, move, countermove, move, move, countermove,” four or five  iterations ahead.They have such a wealth of experience that they instantaneously can recognize the lay of the board; the pattern recognition is extraordinarily  sophisticated.

[翻譯]
大約兩個月前，《時代》，有一篇關於學習的新聞文章。其中提到的一點是，即使你觀察經驗豐富的棋手, 他們實際上並不會想"走步,走步，反制，走步,走步，反制"，四五步 ahead. 他們由於具有豐富的經驗，因此可以瞬間辨識出局面；他們的模式識別能力非常高。

And their level of understanding the game is such that they can  violate the early rules that you are taught in the game, because they can see a  larger purpose.When the piece was written, it was really along the lines of “this is  the way human thinking may be and function.

[翻譯]
而他們對遊戲的理解程度如此之高，以至於他們可以違反遊戲中最初教給你的規則，因為他們能看到更大的目的。當這篇文章寫作時，它實際上是沿著“這就是人類思維可能會以及運作的方式。”這個思路來的。

”  And I’m trying to think, maybe the reason why business people sort of latched onto  it is not because they’d been through the move-countermove-move problem, but  that because they had made so many mistakes in the past, and they’d had so much  experience with how you deal with competitors, that they sort of instantly recognized the validity of that kind of approach.And the whole notion of thinking about  moves and countermoves … in fact, they don’t go much beyond the first iteration.

[翻譯]
我在思考，也許商業人士之所以對這個方法感興趣，並不是因為他們曾經經歷過行動-反行動-再行動的問題，而是因為他們過去犯了很多錯誤，並且在處理競爭對手方面有豐富的經驗，因此他們立刻認識到這種方法的有效性。整個思考行動和對應行動的概念...實際上，他們並沒有深入到第一次迭代之外。

- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: I don’t want to argue this, but it’s an interesting point.I know some guys at  Procter & Gamble.And they’d come up with this shampoo, like Pert.And what  they do is they deliberately test-market it in an area where they knew that the  competitors knew that Procter & Gamble test-marketed, also in an area where  they knew that there was not going to be too much demand for this sort of big  flop.So everybody says, “Nobody wants this.We were thinking about getting into  this.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：對。

Q3：我不想爭論這個問題，但這是一個有趣的觀點。我認識一些在宝洁公司工作的人。他們開發了這種像是Pert的洗髮水。而他們的做法是故意在一個他們知道競爭對手也在進行市場測試的地區進行測試，同時也知道這種大失敗的產品不會受到太多需求的地區。所以每個人都說，「沒有人想要這個。我們本來打算進入這個領域。」

We are not going to get into it.” And P&G has this master plan for them going  massively into it.And they just captured [?] percent of the market when they did.So at least there are a lot of anecdotes of people—  
- Q4: But the calculation there was to send the wrong signals to the [indistinct]  competitor.- Q3: The idea that your action was a form of communication which shapes enemy  behavior in ways which are favorable to your future competitive position.- Q4: Absolutely.

[翻譯]
我們不打算深入探討這個問題。P＆G對他們進行了大規模的計劃。當他們進行時，他們捕捉了市場的百分之多少。所以至少有很多人的軼事- Q4: 但是那裡的計算是發送給競爭對手的錯誤信號。- Q3: 想法是你的行動形成了一種通信形式，可以以有利於未來競爭地位的方式塑造敵人的行為方式。- Q4: 絕對。

I’m not contesting that, not at all.I was reacting to this discussion about  whether we think two, three, or four moves beyond… [indistinct; multiple voices]

我並不否認這一點，一點也不。我是在回應這個討論，關於我們是否可以想到兩、三或四步之外... [不清楚；多重聲音]
- Q2：但是，在建築中，顯然，我們通常很難讓任何人考慮到一步的對立... [不清楚；多重聲音]

I had a discussion with General Lew Allen  [Air Force Chief of Staff, 1978–1982].He said he really wasn’t too sure about this  competitive strategies concept.There were two problems, he felt.One was that  we were so inconstant as a country that we could start something but not carry  through on it, and that could cause the other person to react, but then we would  fall off and we would end up in a worse position than we would otherwise be in.And that’s a very real concern.

[翻譯]
我跟雷倫·阿倫將軍進行了討論 [ 空軍參謀長，1978 年至 1982 年 ]。他說他對這個競爭戰略概念真的不太確定。他覺得有兩個問題。一個問題是，我們作為一個國家是如此不穩定，我們可能開始某件事，但無法堅持下去，這可能會引起對方的反應，但然後我們會掉队，最終會陷入比原本更糟糕的位置。這是一個非常現實的擔憂。

There’s no doubt about that.But the other thing  was that we were up against the Soviets and they’ll just spend the extra money.It was as though they had an endless supply of resources, that there was really no  resource limit, no long-term consequences.- Q3: My memory is that was Weinberger’s initial reaction to this.That the Soviets  were essentially resource-unconstrained.- Marshall: Well, yes.

[翻譯]
毫無疑問。但另一件事是，我們正面對蘇聯，他們會不惜花費額外的資金。他們似乎有無窮的資源供應，似乎真的沒有資源限制，也沒有長遠後果。- 問題3：我記得韋恩伯格對此的最初反應是這樣的。即蘇聯在資源上本質上是不受限制的。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 96 (185 字元) ---
That comes up actually a little later, when we’ll talk about the  USSR endgame, because it was around, I think, ‘85, ‘86 that we actually had a  meeting and presentation for Weinberger.

這個問題實際上是稍後才會提到的，當我們談到蘇聯的最終階段時。因為我記得，大概在1985年或1986年，我們實際上與韋恩伯格進行了會議和演示。

We’d done some things that Iklé  thought he ought to hear, that came out of the Investment Balance, which was  more along the line of, “They are having troubles, and these are…” Weinberger’s  view was that the cost to them of their military programs was very little, that they  didn’t have to spend a large percentage of their gross national product, because  in one form or another, they had slave labor in their plants, and the amount  paid to conscripts was very little.

[翻譯]
我們做了一些伊克勒認為他應該知道的事情，這些事情是出自投資平衡表，更多的是“他們正在遇到困難，而這些是…” 而溫伯格的觀點是，他們軍事計畫的成本非常低，他們不必花費其國民生產總值的大部分，因為他們在一定程度上在工廠中使用奴隸勞工，而向預備兵支付的薪水非常少。

--- 段落 98 (340 字元) ---
Which was true, overall true, but nonetheless  represents a diversion of resources: this man is not doing anything else, he’s over  there in this army.So Weinberger just struck me as someone who had no understanding of economics at all.- Q2: Let me ask you what you know about actual Soviet responses to the competitive strategy initiative.

[翻譯]
儘管整體上是真實的，但仍然表明了資源的分散：這個人並沒有在做別的事情，他在那裡在這支軍隊裡。所以 Weinberger 對我來說就像是完全不懂經濟的人。- Q2：讓我問你知道有關蘇聯對競爭策略倡議的實際回應。

A couple of articles, in journals like Red Star, complained  about this as being another nasty move by the nasty Americans to drive the  Soviet empire onto the ash heap of history, which it already was, but…

一些文章，如《紅星》雜誌上抱怨這是美國人又一個惡劣舉動，企圖將蘇聯帝國推向歷史的灰燼堆，儘管它已經是如此了，但...

[翻譯]
與蘇聯代表團進行了一次代表團會議，可能是軍事方面的... 或者可能是軍事對軍事的會談，我現在記不太清楚了，但我知道它是一次美國國防部級別的對話，與蘇聯軍方或政治軍事機構，比如蘇聯國防部的事情。美國代表團被蘇聯代表團問到“關於這個競爭戰略的事情怎麼樣？” 美國代表團的回答是，“哦，別當真。”

That’s nothing for you guys to really worry about.”  Do you remember that?Marshall: I guess so.I think I remember.Q3: It was the right thing to say in public, because it drove their paranoia level  higher.Q2: It’s also what the guys on the U.S.delegation believed.Marshall: There are other things along that line.I never really looked into it, but  there certainly were several articles and statements by the Russians with a whining “This is unfair” kind of tone, a “You’re trying to bankrupt us!

[翻譯]
這對你們真的不需要擔心。你們記得嗎？馬歇爾：我想是的。我想我記得了。Q3：在公開場合說這句話是對的，因為這增加了他們的偏執狂水平。Q2：這也是美國代表團的人所相信的。馬歇爾：還有其他類似的事情。我從來沒有真正深究，但俄羅斯人肯定有幾篇文章和聲明，抱怨說“這是不公平的”、“你們試圖讓我們破產！”。

That’s foul, foul!”  kind of thing.14 And then there was an astounding statement by a German at one  of our meetings, where we gave a little presentation on it.It was one of the things  on the agenda—and this one officer said, “Well, that could upset the balance.The  U.S.shouldn’t be trying to get ahead.” So there was tied into this whole thing a  sense of disrupting this comfortable parity situation.I don’t have anything more on that.It’s a kind of interesting episode.

[翻譯]
這非常惡劣，非常惡劣！這種事情。14然後在我們的一次會議中，一位德國人發表了令人驚訝的聲明，我們在會議上做了一個小小的演示。這是議程上的其中一個項目，這位軍官說：“嗯，這可能會打破平衡。美國不應該試圖領先。”整個這一切都暗示著破壞這種舒適的平衡狀況。我對此沒有更多信息。這是一個有趣的插曲。

- Q4: In a way, do you think the Soviets understood this better than our own people?- Q2: I think they understood it intuitively, because they do that kind of thing.- Marshall: I thought that by the time this happened, early ‘85 and into ‘86, there  must have been a lot of awareness among these people [the Soviets] that they  were really hurting.So I think that any notion that the U.S.

問題四：你認為蘇聯人比我們自己的人更了解這一點嗎？
問題二：我認為他們直觀地理解了這一點，因為他們做過那種事情。

was systematically  going to do things to drive up their costs or to focus on their weaknesses probably seemed very threatening.- Q4: Not to disagree with you strongly on this, but if perhaps we had done this  in 1962, we might not have provoked the same reaction out of the Soviets.

[翻譯]
Q4：在這一點上我不完全不同意你，但如果可能在1962年我們這樣做，也許就不會激怒蘇聯。對他們進行系統性的行動來提高他們的成本或專注於他們的弱點，可能看起來非常具有威脅性。

--- 段落 105 (492 字元) ---
In  other words, they may not have understood the concept that much; what they  understood was that they were, in fact, in a great deal of difficulty, and when  they saw something that was so clearly going to be focused on that, it was clearly  perceived as a threat.- Marshall: Well, in the late ‘50s, ‘60s, they were still feeling pretty optimistic, according to Vladimir Shlapentokh.And this kind of shift to considerable—  
- Q2: The question was Soviet understanding, not reaction to it.

[翻譯]
換句話說，他們可能並沒有完全理解這個概念；他們理解的是他們確實陷入了極大的困境，當他們看到一個明顯將專注於這個困境的事物時，就會將其視為一種威脅。- 馬歇爾：嗯，在50年代晚期、60年代，他們仍然感到相當樂觀，根據弗拉基米爾·夏普連托赫所述。這種轉變到相當大程度的...問題二：問題是蘇聯對這個理解，而不是對它的反應。

--- 段落 106 (477 字元) ---
I mean, the understanding, I think, would have been the same in ‘62 or ‘85.But the response to it  in the ‘60s…they were much more optimistic about their prospects for success  and so they wouldn’t have been nearly as whining about all this, they would have  gone, “Yeah, that’s what we thought, and now we’re just going to…”  
- Q4: It seems to me it raises an interesting question of why our military didn’t—generalization—our military had a hard time grasping it, or didn’t.

[翻譯]
我的意思是，我認為對於這個理解，在1962年或1985年應該是一樣的。但1960年代對於這個回應... 他們對於成功前景更加樂觀，因此他們不會像現在這樣抱怨，他們會說，“是的，這就是我們的想法，現在我們只是要...”
- 問題4：在我看來，這引出了一個有趣的問題，為什麼我們的軍隊沒有——一般化——我們的軍隊對於這個有困難理解或沒有理解。

--- 段落 107 (414 字元) ---
Our business people did.But here are the Soviets, whose business acumen is somewhat less but  from a military standpoint, they grasped it immediately.There’s something about  the way they were training or developing their officer corps, for example, and the  way we were developing ours which probably— 
- Marshall: I don’t know.It’s hard to know.It’s something you’d have to talk to John  Hines or somebody about.

[翻譯]
我們的商人這樣做了。但現在蘇聯人來了，他們在商業方面的才智稍稍不足，但從軍事角度來看，他們立刻就理解了。也許是他們在訓練或發展軍官隊伍方面的方法，與我們的方法不同，這可能...

- Q2: For example, they obviously are long-time believers…or not believers, but tried  to do this thing, like “reflexive control” has been part of the Soviet military effort.They’ve had, on the General Staff, offices devoted to deception and perception  management and things like that.Clearly, when you have those kinds of organizations that’s a manifestation of an inclination to look at your adversary and what  your adversary is doing and how he’s affected by what you are doing.

[翻譯]
例如，他們顯然是長期的信徒...或者不是信徒，但試圖做這件事，比如“反射性控制”一直是蘇聯軍事努力的一部分。他們在參謀總長部門專門設有偽裝和知覺管理等方面的辦公室。顯然，當你擁有這類組織時，這表明了一種傾向，即看待你的對手以及你的對手正在做什麼以及你所做的會如何影響他。

--- 段落 109 (461 字元) ---
You set up  organizations to try to manage that process.So certainly, it indicates that they’re  more aware of the importance of doing those kinds of things and trying to do  them than we do.We tend to think, “Well, put some loudspeakers on airplanes  and fly around and talk to the population, drop some leaflets, by God, that should  shape perceptions.”  
- Marshall: Let’s go on.I think the next thing we ought to talk about is this nuclear  strategy effort.

[翻譯]
您建立組織以試圖管理這個過程。所以當然，這表明他們比我們更清楚做這些事情的重要性並且試圖去做。我們往往會想，“好吧，給飛機安裝一些扬聲器，繞著飛行並與人口交流，撒些傳單，天哪，這應該能塑造人們的觀念。”
- 馬歇爾：我們繼續吧。我想我們接下來應該談談這個核戰略工作。

--- 段落 110 (410 字元) ---
- Q2: Can I say one other thing on competitive strategies?- Marshall: Yes, OK.- Q2: There have been some efforts since the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the  Soviet Union, to characterize the Strategic Defense Initiative as an effort not really  to deploy a strategic defense, but really a way to bankrupt the Soviets, which  clearly would be a major kind of competitive strategy initiative.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
問2：我可以談談競爭策略嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，好的。- 問2：自華沙條約組織和蘇聯解體以來，有些人試圖將戰略防禦計劃描述為一種實際上並非部署戰略防禦，而是一種使蘇聯破產的方式，顯然這將是一種重大的競爭策略舉措。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 111 (486 字元) ---
- Q2: Did you ever get any indication from talking to Weinberger or any of those people that they saw SDI as kind of this final straw to break the Soviet back by being  such a huge shift in the strategic relationship?- Marshall: I don’t think so.I think a number of them did have this sense that this was  something that the Soviets would have trouble matching.But I don’t think it had  this other aspect.15 You know, if you were [indistinct] talking to people [indistinct]  about that.

[翻譯]
Q2: 從與韋恩伯格或其他人談話的經驗中，你有沒有感覺到他們認為SDI是最後一根稻草，透過這種巨大的戰略關係轉變來瓦解蘇聯？- 馬歇爾：我不這麼認為。我認為其中一些人確實有這種感覺，認為蘇聯難以匹敵這一點。但我不認為這還有其他方面。你知道，如果你正在與人們討論這個話題。

--- 段落 112 (483 字元) ---
OK, nuclear strategy.Here the story is that this was something that Iklé wanted to  do and, I think, right after the election started to focus on this.The idea was the following: In the first years of the first Reagan Administration,  there had been this—I forget what it was called—“road map” or “master plan”…  Master Plan that had been put in place.- Q2: The NWEAMP?The Nuclear Weapons Employment and Acquisition Master Plan.That one?- Marshall: Yeah.That ran out to ‘95, I think.

[翻譯]
好的，核戰略。這個故事是這樣的，Iklé想要做的事情，我想，在選舉之後開始專注於這個問題。這個想法是：在里根政府第一屆任期的最初幾年，曾制定過一個——我忘了它被稱為什麼——“路線圖”或“總體計劃”…一個總體計劃被實施了。- Q2：《核武器就業和採購總體計劃》？那個？- Marshall：對。我想那個一直到'95年。

--- 段落 113 (400 字元) ---
And Iklé said, “We haven’t done the thinking beyond that, and we ought to start that now.” It was also driven by some other  things.First, there could be new technologies.There were going to be stealth  bombers.The way people had thought that they [indistinct] they didn’t take much  account of that, and there weren’t going to be that many until toward the end of  that period, with the Master Plan.

[翻譯]
伊克萊說：“我們還沒有超越那部分的思考，我們應該現在就開始。”這也受到其他一些事情的驅使。首先，可能會有新技術。隱形轟炸機會出現。人們當初的想法沒有太多考慮這一點，直到那個時期結束前才開始增加，而這種情況沒有被計入《總體計劃》。

--- 段落 114 (489 字元) ---
Secondly, as a result of the changes made in nuclear targeting as a result of the stuff done during the Carter Administration,  signed off toward the end of the last year, really…I guess it was ‘79, wasn’t it,  when it was signed off?I forget.- Q2: PD-59 [Presidential Directive 59]?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: Yeah.‘79 or ‘80 [25 Jul 1980].- Marshall: The intelligence effort had been reoriented.One of the results of that was  that we were finding lots and lots of hardened buried structures.

[翻譯]
其次，由於在卡特政府期間所做的事情對核目標進行的變更，簽署在去年底，我想是在1979年，對嗎？我忘了。- Q2：PD-59[總統指令59]？- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：對，1979年或1980年[1980年7月25日]。- 馬歇爾：情報工作已被重新定位。其中一個結果是我們發現了許多硬化埋藏結構。

--- 段落 115 (415 字元) ---
It was a period in  the early ‘80s when we became far more aware of the extent of the underground  construction efforts that had been undertaken.So the character of the target  system that we were going after was changing.Then, in addition, there was the  SDI initiative.This Master Plan was very much in the mold of strategic nuclear planning, thinking that went back to the ‘50s and hadn’t changed at all, really.

[翻譯]
在80年代初期，我們更加意識到地下建設工程所涉及的範圍。所以我們所追求的目標系統的特徵也在改變。此外，還有SDI倡議。這個總體計劃非常符合戰略核規劃的模式，這種思維可以追溯到50年代，實際上從未改變過。

--- 段落 116 (453 字元) ---
Iklé also had always  been concerned with and had some questions about the advisability of relying in  perpetuity on deterrence, as people had formulated it.16 In some sense, we were  staking everything on having the probability of a large-scale war at zero, really  zero, and not really dealing with the issue of, if in some way deterrence fails, what  the hell are we really going to do?He was very interested in that and wanted to  start this effort.

[翻譯]
Iklé一直以來對永久依賴威懾力量的可行性持懷疑態度，並對人們對於此概念的提出提出一些疑問。 從某種意義上說，我們把一切都寄託在將大規模戰爭的機率降至零，實際上是零上，並沒有真正處理的問題，如果在某種情況下威懾失敗了，我們究竟該怎麼辦？他對此非常感興趣，並希望開始這項努力。

--- 段落 117 (448 字元) ---
In the end, the effort was not entirely successful.[Indistinct] there was a lot of work  done, but it didn’t eventuate in any new, real plan that extended beyond the thing.I can’t remember all of it [the Nuclear Strategy Development Group effort], except  that I was put in charge of an analysis steering group, I guess it was, and oversaw  various analytic studies that were done in connection with this, although a lot of  them were parceled out.

[翻譯]
最終，這個努力並不完全成功。有很多工作被完成，但最後並沒有出現任何新的、真正超越當前事務的計劃。我記不清所有細節[有關核戰略發展小組的努力]，只記得我被派負責一個分析指導小組，我想是這樣，並監督了與此有關的各種分析研究，儘管其中很多被分拆出去。

--- 段落 118 (459 字元) ---
One of the things that was done was a whole series of  war games that, in particular, looked at the effect of potential SDI programs.If I  remember, there were 14 of these things played over about two years.I thought  they had some very interesting results.And as people played through them,  repeatedly, various situations…  We started the games with people kind of playing Red and Blue as though they  were the national command authorities on the two sides.

[翻譯]
其中一項措施是進行一系列的軍事演習，尤其關注潛在的SDI計劃的影響。如果我沒記錯的話，大約有14場這樣的演習持續約兩年。我覺得這些演習有一些非常有趣的結果。當人們反覆參與這些演習時，各種情況不斷出現... 我們開始這些演習時，讓人們扮演紅方和藍方，就好像他們是兩邊的國家指揮當局一般。

--- 段落 119 (435 字元) ---
After the first couple  of games, I threw that out the window, because, in the first place, I think the kind  of people who you get to play these games don’t reproduce the kind of behavior you get from really top-level leaders.Secondly, they spend all of their time  endlessly on stuff that they’re not very good at.So the second kind of game we  organized around the notion of, “Alright, you people are essentially the general  staff.

[翻譯]
在最初幾場比賽之後，我放棄了這個想法，因為首先，我認為參與這些遊戲的人並不像真正頂尖領導者那樣表現優秀。其次，他們花費所有時間在他們不擅長的事情上。所以我們組織第二種遊戲的概念是：“好吧，你們本質上是總參謀部。"

--- 段落 120 (481 字元) ---
You are planning what war plans will be, and then you play through the  things.” And that turned out to be far more effective.They could play these roles  and it got them out of the political bullshitting they did otherwise.And the outcome, I thought, had taught me some things, anyway.First, what the  games showed was that contrary to the kind of argumentation that was going on  about SDI, the people in the game found the presence of SDI systems stabilizing, not destabilizing.

[翻譯]
你正在計劃戰爭計劃，然後你通過實際演練事情。這證明效果更好。他們可以扮演這些角色，這讓他們擺脫了他們平常所做的政治胡扯。而結果，我認為至少教會了我一些東西。首先，這些遊戲所展示的是，與關於反導彈防禦計劃的論辯相反，遊戲中的人們發現反導系統的存在是穩定的，而不是不穩定的。

--- 段落 121 (386 字元) ---
The argument tended to be, “It’s going to be destabilizing  because one or both sides are going to see that if the other side is going to attack,  then I have fewer missiles, and I can’t get through, and therefore he’s going to do  me in, and so on.” But, in fact, in the games people had just psychologically the  other reaction, and it wasn’t that they were stupid or not calculating.

[翻譯]
爭論往往是，“這將是不穩定的，因為一方或雙方會認為如果另一方要進攻，我只有更少的導彈，並且無法穿透，因此他會對我造成危害，等等。”但實際上，在遊戲中，人們只是在心理上產生另一種反應，這並不是因為他們愚蠢或不計算。

--- 段落 122 (390 字元) ---
Because if  both sides had these systems, the first strike, the initiating strike was not going to  be as successful.And both sides also felt more secure.One of the other things, though, of course, that happened in the games was  that the players moved toward strategies in which the first thing they tried to  do was degrade the other guy’s SDI system, not just strike out at his homeland.

[翻譯]
因為如果雙方都擁有這些系統，首次打擊，發動攻擊不會那麼成功。而且雙方也會感到更安全。然而，遊戲中發生的另一件事是，玩家們朝著首先嘗試破壞對方的反導彈系統的策略移動，而不僅僅是對他的祖國發動攻擊。

--- 段落 123 (496 字元) ---
And, of course, if one side is able to remove the other guy’s SDI and keep his own  or something like that, you have a very asymmetrical situation and the person  without an SDI ought to give up.So you had a very different kind of situation.And it also convinced me that such  things as the “Nitze criteria” are nonsense.17  
- Q3: What is that?- Marshall: The cost-effectiveness kind of thing.Because the insertion of an SDI  system into the overall picture changes the whole nature of the game.

[翻譯]
當然，如果一方能夠摧毀對方的防禦系統並保留自己的，或其他類似的情況，就會產生一種非常不對稱的局面，沒有防禦能力的人應該放棄。這種情況顯然非常不同，也讓我相信諸如“尼茲標準”之類的東西都是無稽之談。

- Q3：那是什麼？- 馬歇爾：成本效益類型的東西。因為將防禦系統納入整個圖景會改變整個遊戲的性質。

That’s the  big thing that happens…  If you continue on as though it’s still the same game, you’re just not getting it.And so that all of the kind of usual systems analysis— And the RAND guys ran  some stuff that was nonsense, took their earlier models and ran them, which  just showed me how awful most of the analysis was, that people just don’t think  about how things change.18 And I tried to use analogies: OK, here’s chess.And you  know how to play it.

[翻譯]
這就是發生的重要事情... 如果你繼續按照仍然是同一場比賽的方式進行，你就完全沒有理解。因此，所有通常的系統分析都... 蘭德公司的人進行了一些毫無意義的東西，運行了他們以前的模型，這僅僅展示了大多數分析是多麼糟糕，人們根本就沒有考慮事物如何變化。我試圖使用類比: 好吧，這是象棋。你知道如何下棋。

But supposing the board is enlarged a little and two new  pieces are put in that have different moves than any of the existing pieces.That’s  a new game.And the opening might be different.So playing your usual openings  might not be a smart thing to do in this new game.And this was the significance  of SDI systems, if they could ever get put in place, that is.That’s how you ought to  think about them.

[翻譯]
但假設棋盤稍作擴大，並且加入兩件具有不同走法的新棋子。那就是一場新的遊戲。並且開局可能也會有所不同。因此，在這種新遊戲中，玩你平常的開局可能不是明智之舉。這就是SDI系統的重要性，如果它們最終能夠被建立起來的話。你應該這樣去思考它們。

In those kind of circumstances, it’s one of the virtues of war games that they allow  you to get at it, get some preliminary notion of how the whole nature of the  game has changed and how you ought to be thinking about things like measures  and what’s important.If you go on with the standard systems analysis, guys who  just take the old models and run them with some new things in them, you’re  probably going to get the wrong answers.

[翻譯]
在這種情況下，戰爭遊戲的一個優勢是它們讓你去探討，讓你對整個遊戲性質如何改變以及應該如何思考措施和重要性有了初步概念。如果你繼續使用標準系統分析，只是拿著舊模型並加入一些新元素進行運行的人，你可能會得到錯誤的答案。

- Q2: Was it the NSDG games that also really highlighted this notion of “preferential  defense,” and the kind of leverage you got off of preferential defense, or was that  another series?- Marshall: No.People knew about preferential defense.That came out of the standard calculations.Q?: [Indistinct] way back in the ‘60s.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: On the RSAS [RAND Strategy Assessment System], were you trying to use the  RSAS to get at some of these things?

[翻譯]
問題2：是NSDG遊戲真正突出了“偏好防守”這個概念，以及你從偏好防守中得到的槓桿效應，還是另一個系列嗎？- 馬歇爾：不是。人們知道偏好防守。這是基於標準計算得出的。問題？：[不清楚]回到60年代。- 馬歇爾：對，沒錯。- 問題2：在RSAS [RAND戰略評估系統]上，你是想利用RSAS來瞭解其中一些事情嗎？

--- 段落 128 (482 字元) ---
- Marshall: The original notion of the RSAS came out of the Defense Science Board  Summer Study of ‘78, where there was a look at the whole issue of the nuclear  balance.And, of course, I’ve had the kind of heretical view that most of the analysis  of the nuclear situation is pretty poor.So out of that came a recommendation that  we use a much more war-gaming approach to looking at the nuclear balance, and  also embed it in a wider war.19 I think we talked about this last time.

[翻譯]
Marshall：RSAS的最初概念來自1978年的國防科學委員會夏季研究，那時對核平衡的整個問題進行了研究。當然，我一直持有著大部分核情況分析相當糟糕的異端觀點。因此，建議使用更多的戰爭遊戲方法來研究核平衡，並將其納入更廣泛的戰爭中。上次我們討論過這個問題。

Strategic  nuclear conflict tends to be treated as though it’s a detached weight-lifting  contest; here is the football game going on over here and then over to one side  there is a weight-lifting contest that’s not connected with this ongoing game.And it has a lot of other difficulties, the standard analysis.

[翻譯]
戰略核衝突往往被看待為一場獨立的舉重比賽；這裡是正在進行的足球比賽，然後在一旁有一場與這場比賽無關的舉重比賽。這種標準分析帶有許多其他困難。

It just arbitrarily treated  nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines as having no vulnerabilities, which  is not true, particularly if there were any kind of extended conventional phase,  when the worst that might happen is the attrition of the submarines, particularly  on one side.Might make a difference, huh?Not in any of the known calculations  of the strategic balance.- Q3: You weren’t always [indistinct].

[翻譯]
它僅僅任意地將核動力彈道導彈潛艇視為毫無弱點，這並不是事實，特別是如果存在任何形式的延長常規階段時，當最糟糕的情況可能是潛艇的消耗，特別是在一方。這可能會有所影響，對吧？但這並不在我們所知道的戰略平衡的任何計算中。- Q3：您以前不總是這樣。

--- 段落 131 (488 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, wait a minute… Alright, so we… Look, that was the notion for that,  though.Then the guys at RAND kind of screwed it up as far as I was concerned,  and you could never drag them back to what its original purpose was.They ended up developing it as a way of analyzing regional wars.20  
- Q2: Well, even there it was screwed up.- Marshall: Yeah, we understand that.So we did not use it for… In principle, it could  have been if it had ever fulfilled the earlier hopes, yes.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：等等……好吧，這樣看來我們……看，這是原本的構想，雖然。但是，蘭德公司的人弄得我看不下去，他們永遠無法將它還原到原本的目的。他們最後將其發展成為分析區域戰爭的工具。

問2：即使是在那方面也被弄壞了。- 馬歇爾：是的，我們明白。所以我們沒有用它……原則上，如果它能實現早期的期望，是的。

--- 段落 132 (434 字元) ---
Look, they were not good  at almost anything.They didn’t have the right idea of the regional conventional  fight, and they never got on with what was supposedly the fundamental purpose  of doing it— to really get at large-scale nuclear warfare in the context of a wider  war.- Q3: I just remember this one briefing that we went to.The briefer said, “Well, regional warfare is so complicated, we can’t treat everything in equal detail.

[翻譯]
看，他們在幾乎所有事情上都做得不好。他們對區域傳統戰爭的概念不正確，也從未真正達到執行的根本目的——在更廣泛的戰爭背景下解決大規模核戰。 - Q3:我只記得我們參加的一次簡報。簡報者說：“區域戰爭是如此複雜，我們無法平等對待每件事情。”

We’re just  going to not look at the NATO northern region or the Far East, because it’s totally  irrelevant for the nuclear war thing.” And Andy starts going… “Where the hell do  you think those bastions are going to be?”  Q5: I can remember reading advertisements from RAND.At a certain point, this  [RSAS] was the flagship of the RAND Corporation.-  Marshall: Yeah, right.OK, this nuclear strategy thing went on until about the middle  of ‘86, I think, so it was going on about a year and a half.

[翻譯]
我們只要不看北約北部地區或遠東，因為這對於核戰事完全無關緊要。”安迪開始問道：“你認為那些據點會在哪裡？”我記得讀過RAND的廣告。某個時候，這個[RSAS]是RAND公司的旗艦。”馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。這個核戰略一直持續到大約1986年中期，所以大約持續了一年半。

Then in the middle of ‘86,  Wohlstetter and Iklé sold the idea of this commission [Commission on Integrated  Long-Term Strategy].Originally, it was jointly sponsored by the NSC and by the  Defense Department.And as the thing ended, the NSC kind of withdrew.But it  was started in the middle of ‘86.- Q2: Was Bill Cockell on the NSC?- Marshall: Yeah, I think so.So there was the commission.[Indistinct] I forget everybody who was on it, but there were four working groups.

[翻譯]
在1986年的中期，沃爾斯泰特和伊克勒推銷了這個委員會的構想[綜合長期戰略委員會]。最初，這是由國家安全委員會和國防部共同贊助的。隨著事情的結束，國家安全委員會有些退出了。但這是在1986年中期開始的。問題2：比爾·科克爾在國家安全委員會嗎？馬歇爾：是的，我想是。所以有這個委員會。我忘了所有在委員會上的人，但有四個工作小組。

--- 段落 135 (421 字元) ---
Retired General Paul  Gorman ran one on low-intensity warfare.Henry Rowen and Fred Hoffman ran  one on power projection on the periphery of the Soviet Union.Charlie Herzfeld  ran one on technology.And Charlie Wolf and I ran one on the future security  environment, in which we tried to provide to the commission a view of what the  next 20 years might look like.21 So we formed a group of people to help us look at  that.

[翻譯]
退役上將保羅·戈爾曼主持了一場低強度戰爭的研討會。亨利·羅溫和弗雷德·霍夫曼主持了一場關於在蘇聯周邊進行權力投射的研討會。查理·赫茲菲德主持了一場關於科技的研討會。查理·沃爾夫和我主持了一場關於未來安全環境的研討會，嘗試向委員會提供未來20年可能的情況。因此，我們組成了一個小組來幫助我們研究這個問題。

At RAND, in particular, they did long-term economic projections, which have  turned out to hold up very, very well.They made a big breakthrough.They were the first people to apply purchasing  power parity to China.Otherwise, you had these people doing all these things  and then this Chinese number prepared on a totally different basis [indistinct].And at least for me, the study of the future security environment was very formative in terms of my thinking.

[翻譯]
在蘭德公司，特別是他們進行了長期的經濟預測，這些預測被證明非常非常準確。他們取得了一個重大突破。他們是第一批將購買力平價應用到中國的人。否則，你會發現有許多人在做這些事情，然後有一個中國數字，但是這些數字是基於完全不同的基礎準備的。至少對我來說，對未來安全環境的研究對我的思維方式非常具影響力。

--- 段落 137 (453 字元) ---
Really, I haven’t changed my views on the basic  sort of things going on in the world that much since that time.I came out of that  experience feeling that three big things are happening, from a defense point of  view.One is this geopolitical transition, which we weren’t able to articulate well,  because Iklé didn’t want us to point out how weak we thought the Soviet Union  was and was likely to be.Another is the proliferation of weaponry and so on.

[翻譯]
其實，自那時以來，我對世界上基本變化的看法並沒有太大改變。我從那次經歷中感覺到，從防禦的角度來看，有三件大事正在發生。其中一件是地緣政治轉變，我們無法清楚表達，因為伊克勒不希望我們指出我們認為蘇聯是多麼薄弱並且有可能繼續薄弱。另一件是武器擴散等等。

But the thing that is, I think, interesting to talk about in the context of this  commission was that both Charlie and I were, in fact, very frustrated by… In fact,  even though people seemed to agree, and it was included in the more general  summary document, I came away with the feeling, and I think Charlie also, that  the commission itself, because of the preoccupations of Albert Wohlstetter and to  some extent Fred, but particularly Albert, was much nearer term in its focus.

[翻譯]
但在這個委員會的情況下，我認為有趣的是，查理和我實際上都對...感到非常沮喪。事實上，即使人們似乎同意，而且它也包含在更一般的摘要文件中，我卻帶著一種感覺離開了，我想查理也是一樣，委員會本身，因為阿爾伯特·沃爾斯特特的關注，和在某種程度上弗雷德，但特別是阿爾伯特，更加關注近期的焦點。

While  the thing was supposed to be about the next 20 years, it was in large part about  undoing wrong thinking of the past and talking about what you would do, the  forces you needed now.Far more remained very focused on the Russians, didn’t  really deal with other things, and remained very, very focused on the Russians.Let me tell you a story.One of the meetings of the full commission was held in the  Old Executive Office Building.

[翻譯]
儘管這件事情應該是關於未來20年，但它在很大程度上是關於改變過去的錯誤思維，談論你將要做什麼，現在你需要的力量。 更多的人還是很專注於俄羅斯人，沒有真正處理其他事情，仍然非常非常專注於俄羅斯人。 讓我告訴你一個故事。 全體委員會的一次會議是在舊行政辦公樓舉行的。

--- 段落 141 (453 字元) ---
I remember during one of the breaks going down  the hall to the men’s room with General [Retired] Jack Vessey and telling him my  sense about the commission and the fact that they just weren’t getting it in terms  of what I thought Charlie Wolf and I were trying to tell them.And he sort of said,  “Well, I agree with you.The Russians have had it.It’s just a matter of time.” This  would be the spring of ‘88 [before Dec 1987], I guess, about that time.

[翻譯]
我記得在休息時間之一，我和退役將軍傑克·韋西（Jack Vessey）一起走到走廊去男廁所時，告訴他我對委員會的感覺，以及我認為查理·沃爾夫（Charlie Wolf）和我試圖告訴他們的事情。他有點說，“嗯，我同意你。俄羅斯人已經完蛋了。只是個時間問題。”我想這應該是在‘88年的春天（1987年12月之前），大概是那個時候。

--- 段落 142 (383 字元) ---
I tell you  the story mainly because here’s Vessey, who says he agrees, but he doesn’t say  anything [about it to anyone else].So you can have these situations where a lot of  people really know what’s happening, but it somehow isn’t quite accepted openly  to talk about it.- Q4: Why would Vessey have been mute on the subject?Hardly known for being bashful.- Marshall: I don’t know.

[翻譯]
我告訴你這個故事主要是因為這裡有一個叫Vessey的人，他說他同意，但他沒對任何人談起這件事。所以你會發現這樣的情況，很多人確實知道正在發生的事情，但卻不會公開談論。- Q4: Vessey為什麼對這個話題保持沉默？這個人通常不是靦腆的。- Marshall: 我不知道。

--- 段落 143 (327 字元) ---
Again, to really say that at that point still was to say something which, as I say, some people might increasingly believe, but maybe people aren’t sure enough, whatever it is, but they’re not willing to say, “Look, this document ought to be different.We ought to [focus?]…”  And as I mentioned to you, talk about [indistinct].

[翻譯]
再說，當時真正說的是什麼，正如我所說的，有些人可能越來越相信，但也許人們還不確定，不管是什麼，但他們不願意說，“看，這份文件應該要有所不同。我們應該要[專注？]...” 正如我之前提到的，談論 [不清楚的部分]。

--- 段落 144 (498 字元) ---
As we were approaching putting  the thing out, at one point Wolf and I made the argument that the base case for  the Russian economy ought to be not the Central Intelligence Agency number,  but it ought to be a number which puts instead of… The CIA number at the time  gave the Soviet GNP as about 55 percent of the U.S.GNP, but we thought it’s more  like 30 to 35 percent, and that ought to be the base case, and there ought to be  this potentially higher one if we’re wrong, and then a lower one.

[翻譯]
當我們開始着手提出這個方法時，Wolf和我曾經辯論說，俄羅斯經濟的基本情況應該不是中央情報局提供的數字，而應該是一個數字，將派代替......當時中央情報局的數字顯示蘇聯的國民生產總值約為美國的55%，但我們認為更接近30至35%，這應該是基本情況，如果我們錯了，還應該有一個更高的數字，然後一個更低的。

--- 段落 145 (422 字元) ---
But what we  ended up doing was, essentially on Iklé’s insistence, that the base case be the CIA  number, which I thought was totally hokum at that point, and had for some years,  and then we had, I think, two other cases that were lower.22 So that’s the way that  we handled that.The other thing where what we felt didn’t quite get reflected in the final result  was about AIDS, which we felt to be a major sort of thing.

[翻譯]
但最終我們做的是，在Iklé的堅持下，基本情況是CIA的數據，我當時認為這完全是胡說八道，而且已經這麼多年了，然後我們還有，我想，兩個比較低的案例。這就是我們處理這個問題的方式。另一件讓我們感到未能在最終結果中得到反映的事情是關於艾滋病，我們認為這是一件重大的事情。

--- 段落 146 (387 字元) ---
It hasn’t turned out to  be quite as big an economic problem for the United States as I thought it might  be, but we felt it was going be a big thing.Iklé was concerned that the report, at  least the summary report, really not say much of anything about AIDS because  it’s the kind of thing that the journalists would grab ahold of and wouldn’t pay  attention to the real central things.

[翻譯]
這並沒有像我原先想像的那樣成為美國的一個重大經濟問題，但我們認為這將是一件重要的事情。Iklé擔心報告，至少是摘要報告，實際上並沒有多少關於愛滋病的內容，因為這種事情是記者們會抓住並不會注意真正核心問題的東西。

--- 段落 147 (409 字元) ---
But at any rate, I thought the future security environment thing was very interesting and certainly formative of my own views.Q2: How would you rate the other three working group products?- Marshall: I thought Gorman’s thing was quite good, the—  Q3: Really?I thought he went really overboard in the application of information  technologies to the conduct of the counterinsurgency mission.- Marshall: Umm-hmm.

[翻譯]
但無論如何，我覺得未來的安全環境是非常有趣的，肯定對我的觀點有所形成。Q2: 你會如何評價其他三個工作小組的成果？- 馬歇爾：我覺得高曼的成果相當不錯，但是......Q3: 真的嗎？我覺得他在應用資訊技術於反叛亂任務中做得太過火了。- 馬歇爾：嗯。

--- 段落 148 (440 字元) ---
- Q3: I mean, he’s a very smart guy and knows a lot, but I always remember being very  skeptical about that.In other words, if you had Cray supercomputers and “thinking  machine” parallel processors, boy, you could have really done a job in El Salvador.I thought, well…?- Marshall: Yeah.Well, let me say of all the other three, I think he’s the best.The technology one—I guess there was a lot of pulling and hauling among the people  there.

[翻譯]
問3: 我的意思是，他是一個非常聰明的人，懂得很多，但我總是對此感到非常懷疑。換句話說，如果你有Cray超級計算機和“思考機”並行處理器，哇，你可以在薩爾瓦多真的完成一項任務。我想，嗯...？- 馬歇爾: 是的。嗯，讓我說說其他三個人中，我認為他是最好的。關於技術-I猜那裡的人們之間有很多拉扯。

--- 段落 149 (447 字元) ---
- Q3: People seemed to be using it to push their pet projects.- Marshall: Yeah.And the other one, the power projection report, the other kind of  scenarios, was sort of OK, but nothing new.Well, then that gets into this USSR endgame.Again, over this period I was becoming progressively more convinced that the CIA numbers were wrong; their  estimate of the Soviet GNP is too big, and they’re underestimating the size of  the military expenditures.

[翻譯]
Q3：人們似乎在利用它來推動他們的寵物項目。- 馬歇爾：是的。另一個是權力投射報告，另一種情境，看起來還好，但沒有什麼新意。嗯，那就涉及到蘇聯的終局。同樣，在這段時間內，我逐漸越來越相信CIA的數據是錯誤的；他們對蘇聯國內生產總值的估計太大，他們低估了軍事支出的規模。

Dennis Ross has come back to Washington and is at  the NSC.I go and have talks with him from time to time.And Dennis is telling me about the discussions he’s having with people sort of comparably positioned, I  guess, in Russia.I suppose some of them are in the foreign ministry, some of them  are in some of the Party committees.He tells me how seemingly frank and open  things are.

[翻譯]
丹尼斯·羅斯已經回到華盛頓，在國家安全會議工作。我偶爾會去找他談話。丹尼斯告訴我有關他和俄羅斯一些地位相對應的人進行討論的情況。我想一些人可能在外交部工作，一些人可能在某些黨委員會。他告訴我看似坦率和開放的對話。

--- 段落 151 (489 字元) ---
And I keep telling him—and, of course, we’re in the midst of various  arms control negotiations and other things—one of my themes is, “Look Dennis,  you need to think of the people you’re talking about as Louis XVI’s ministers.They’re  not going to be there very long.Time is on our side.They’re going to come apart.Instead of making long lists of fallback positions in negotiations, we ought to be  looking at and putting lists of we want, what are our demands as their position  weakens.

[翻譯]
而我一直告訴他——當然，我們正處於各種軍備控制談判和其他事務中——我的一個主題是，“看啊，Dennis，你需要把你所談論的人看作是路易十六的大臣。他們不會在那裡很長時間，時間在我們這邊。他們會解散。我們應該不是在談判中列出後退位置的長列表，而是應該看看和制定我們想要的列表，我們的要求隨著他們的立場變弱時。”

--- 段落 152 (453 字元) ---
” In fact, we had a meeting here in this room, where Dennis actually  came with the idea, “Let’s just generate some of this.” It didn’t turn out to be very  successful.People couldn’t get into the spirit of things, from my perspective.Q2: So you didn’t have withdrawal from Eastern Europe on that list or anything like  that?- Marshall: No.- Q3: Partition of the Soviet Union?- Marshall: No, nothing interesting.We didn’t have really detailed scenarios.

[翻譯]
事實上，在這個房間裡我們開了一次會議，Dennis提出了一個想法，說“我們只是來生成一些東西。”這並不成功。從我看來，人們無法投入其中。Q2：那麼你們的清單上沒有從東歐撤離或其他類似的事情嗎？- 馬歇爾：沒有。- Q3：蘇聯解體？- 馬歇爾：沒有，沒有有趣的事情。我們並沒有真正詳細的情景。

--- 段落 153 (358 字元) ---
It probably would have been a good thing to do that.We didn’t do that.It was just sort of,  “Look, these guys are in deep, deep trouble.”  
- Q3: Just let me ask a point of clarification.Was Dennis, when he was talking with his  Soviet counterparts…They were telling him how bad things were in the Soviet  Union?- Marshall: No.It was more how open they were.

[翻譯]
這可能本來是一個好主意。我們沒有這樣做。只是有點像是，「看來這些人碰到了很大的麻煩。」

- Q3: 讓我來澄清一點。當丹尼斯與蘇聯同行交談時... 他們告訴他蘇聯的情況有多糟糕嗎？
- 馬歇爾：不是。更多的是他們有多麼開放。

--- 段落 154 (481 字元) ---
Presumably they talked about some  of their own internal problems, but it was more how open, how more approachable, how willing to discuss things, you know, they were.During this period, the people who were relaying stuff about how things were  coming apart and so on were still people like Shlapentokh and Jim Billington and  Igor Birman, and occasionally Vladimir Bukovsky would come by and talk.There  was a growing set of stories, but mainly corning still from the same people.

[翻譯]
他們可能會討論一些他們自己的內部問題，但更主要是關於他們有多開放、有多可親近、有多願意討論事情。在這段時間裡，轉達事情出來的人還是像Shlapentokh、Jim Billington和Igor Birman這樣的人，偶爾還有Vladimir Bukovsky會過來聊聊天。故事開始增多，但主要還是來自同一群人。

Also  about this time, Charlie Wolf had become convinced… he’d done this stuff on the  “cost of empire.” I forget the dates, exactly, of when that…  
- Q3: I think it was a little bit earlier.- Marshall: But he went through a second stage of things.The first set was done in  the early ‘80s, but then there was some other stuff that was done.23  
- Q3: It’s the ‘85–‘88 time frame that the Anders Åslund papers started to circulate.- Marshall: Yeah, and Anders Åslund came and we talked with him.

[翻譯]
在這個時候，查理·沃爾夫已經堅信… 他對“帝國的代價”這些事情感到疑惑。我忘了確切的日期是什麼時候了…  
- Q3: 我覺得這可能稍早一點。- 馬歇爾: 但他經歷了第二個階段。第一批是在80年代初實施的，但後來還有其他一些東西。

24 He had spent this  year [1987–88] at the Wilson Center.So there was a gradual increase of things.And  then there was a meeting at Stanford that must have occurred at this time, of some  people from the Agency and a lot of the critics about the estimates of the Soviet  economy, some of which ended up in this book [The Impoverished Superpower].25  Also ‘86 was the time of the meeting of the four of us with President Ronald  Reagan.

他在這一年（1987–88）在威爾遜中心度過。事情逐漸增加。然後在史丹佛大學舉行了一次會議，當時應該有來自機構的一些人和許多批評家對蘇聯經濟估計的討論，其中一些最終出現在這本書中《The Impoverished Superpower》。同時，1986年我們四人與總統羅納德·里根的會面也發生在這個時候。

At the meeting, Rowen talked some about the economy in general; Charlie talked  about the “cost of empire” thing; I talked about the military burden and how  it ought to be looked at, particularly in view of the reduced estimates that we  ought to have of the GNP, the gross underestimates of the resources going into  the military establishment; and then Treml talked about the combination of the  “second economy,” and the corruption, and the mistakes he thought were being  made, and the importance of the imported technology from the West, and the  distortions in the pricing system, and so on.

[翻譯]
在會議上，羅文大致談了一些有關經濟的事情；查理談了有關“帝國成本”的問題；我則談到軍事負擔以及應該如何檢視它，特別是考慮到我們對國民生產總值（GNP）的降低估計，以及對軍事機構投入資源的嚴重低估；然後特倫談到了“第二經濟”的組合，以及腐敗問題和他認為正在發生的錯誤，以及從西方輸入技術的重要性，以及價格體系中的扭曲等等。

馬歇爾：他沒有說太多，只是在不同時候點頭，基本上說，“我同意你的觀點。” 布什絲毫沒有說什麼。貝克問了一兩個問題。會議大約持續了一個小時。我們每個人大約講了十分鐘，然後有時間提問。整個過程，正如我所說的，都是在做一個決定，是否會成為G7議程中的一個項目。最後，事實證明不是這樣。

Because the notion of this  NSC guy was, “Look, if we’ve been making these mistakes in these estimates, we  ought to see what other people’s views are and get into a discussion of, ‘What if  they’re really in all of this trouble?’”  
- Q3: Can you say who the NSC guy was who made the meeting [indistinct]?- Marshall: Lou Pugliaresi  
- Q3: He was brought on as sort of one of the senior economic analysts [indistinct].- Marshall: That’s right, yeah.

[翻譯]
因為這個 NSC 的人的概念是，“看起來，如果我們在這些估算上犯了這些錯誤，我們應該看看其他人的看法，並討論一下，‘如果他們真的在所有這些困境中怎麼辦？’”
- Q3: 你能說出那個 NSC 的人是誰召集了會議嗎？- 馬歇爾：盧·普利亞雷西
- Q3: 他被聘用為高級經濟分析師之一。- 馬歇爾：對，沒錯。

--- 段落 163 (458 字元) ---
He’s the one who arranged it, because he became  aware of the stuff that I was doing, Harry and Charlie…  
- Q3: Lou was also tight with Dennis.- Marshall: Yeah.The last thing to say about this USSR endgame is that as this period  wore on, more and more my view was, look, we’ve won.Really, it’s like in chess.You’ve come out of the middle game.You have this tremendous advantage in  material, but you’ve got to not screw up the endgame.You still got to win.

[翻譯]
他是安排这一切的人，因为他知道我和哈利、查理在做什么...
- Q3: 路也和丹尼斯关系密切。- 马歇尔：是的。关于苏联的这场终局，最后要说的是，随着时间的推移，我越来越认为，我们赢了。实际上，就像下棋一样。你已经走出了中盘。你在物质上占了巨大优势，但你不能搞砸终局。你仍然要赢。

--- 段落 164 (460 字元) ---
So the  whole thing to really focus on is being bright about the endgame.I’d say the last year of this period was very much time [indistinct] into the first part  of the Bush Administration.One of the things I did, I wrote a memo to Secretary  of Defense Frank Carlucci.Weinberger left and Carlucci came in.I would never  have bothered to send it to Weinberger, but I did send it then to Carlucci, about  six months before the end of the Reagan Administration.

[翻譯]
所以真正需要專注的是對結局的理解。我會說這段期間的最後一年非常集中在布什政府的第一部分。其中一件事是，我寫了一封備忘錄給國防部長弗蘭克·卡盧奇。魏茲伯格離開了，卡盧奇接任了。我從來不會打擾魏茲伯格，但我當時確實發送了這封備忘錄給卡盧奇，在雷根政府結束前大約六個月之前。

--- 段落 165 (496 字元) ---
It was a memo that was  aimed at influencing what the last posture statement would say.The memo said  to him that there’s a very substantial chance that the Soviet Union will not be able  to keep up, that they will have to cut back on their military establishment, that  the country may founder.We ought to start thinking about positioning ourselves  about how we’re going to defend the defense budget when this happens.Q3: You’re so sly, Andy.How’d you get to be so sly?- Marshall: I don’t know.

[翻譯]
這是一份旨在影響最終立場聲明內容的備忘錄。這份備忘錄告訴他，蘇聯很可能無法跟上，他們將不得不削減軍事設施，這個國家可能會陷入困境。我們應該開始考慮如何在這種情況下保衛國防預算。Q3: 安迪，你真狡猾。你怎麼變得這麼狡猾？- 馬歇爾：我不知道。

--- 段落 166 (388 字元) ---
It’s all obvious.My view about it is it’s all so obvious that—  
- Q3: To me, in the mid-1980s, it was not so obvious that the Soviet Union was going  to collapse [indistinct] serious difficulties [indistinct].- Marshall: Well, this would be in the middle of ‘88.Yes, I wrote in this memo…  
- Q3: I’m not arguing with you.- Marshall: Well, I didn’t envisage the rapidity of the collapse.

[翻譯]
這一切都是顯而易見的。對我來說，在1980年代中期，蘇聯即將崩潰並非那麼明顯，出現了嚴重困難。- 馬歇爾：這將是在1988年中期。是的，我在這份備忘錄中寫道...- Q3：我並不是在和你爭辯。- 馬歇爾：嗯，我沒有預見到崩潰的速度。

--- 段落 167 (484 字元) ---
But by that time General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev is really screwing everything up and things are  really coming apart.Anyway, I felt that…  
- Q2: You saw some major shift going on.- Marshall: Oh yes.At any rate, I said that it was dangerous for the Defense Department… As I say, the memo was targeted on how they ought to be beginning to  talk about things and not write a posture statement that…  Q2: Was threat-driven, Soviet-driven defense budget.What was Carlucci’s reaction?

[翻譯]
但到那時，總書記米哈伊爾·戈爾巴喬夫真的搞砸了一切，情況真的開始混亂。不管怎樣，我覺得…  
- Q2: 你看到一些重大變化正在發生。- 馬歇爾: 是的。無論如何，我說國防部這樣做是危險的…正如我所說的，這份備忘錄的重點在於他們應該開始討論事情，而不是撰寫一份關於… Q2: 威脅驅動、蘇聯主導的國防預算。卡爾魯奇有什麼反應？

--- 段落 168 (454 字元) ---
- Marshall: I never heard a word.- Q2: That was his reaction.- Marshall: That’s right.Q4: And he’s a businessman.- Q2: That’s not clear from his experience at Sears.Q3: Let me ask you kind of a contrarian question.I remember at least as late as ‘84,  maybe ‘85, that one of the things that you and I always used to also talk about  was the need to think through, “What if we really had to quadruple American  defense spending?”  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：我沒有聽到他說一句話。
- Q2: 那是他的反應。
- 馬歇爾：沒錯。
- Q4: 而他是一個商人。
- Q2: 從他在西爾斯的經驗來看，這一點並不清楚。
- Q3: 讓我問你一個有點反對派的問題。我記得至少到84年，也許是85年，你和我總是談論到過需要仔細思考，“如果我們真的需要將美國的國防開支增加四倍該怎麼辦？”
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

--- 段落 169 (486 字元) ---
- Q3: Because, you know, we’re thinking… I heard of specific scenarios [indistinct] but  the chances of a really radical American foreign policy catastrophe were one in  four, as I recall, [consensus?] figure— 
- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: —and that, therefore, one of the things we have to get people doing is, forget  about this, “How do we justify the two-percent increase over what we’ve got?”  kind of stuff, but what if we have to go into a 1950–51-style buildup?- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
Q3: 因為，你知道，我們正在考慮…我聽說過特定情況[不清楚]，但我記得美國外交政策發生極端災難的機會是四分之一，[共識？]這個數字–
- 馬歇爾: 是的。- Q3: –因此，我們必須讓人們忘記“我們如何為我們所得到的百分之二增加辯護？”這種東西，而是考慮如果我們必須進行像1950-1951年那樣的建設。
- 馬歇爾: 是的，對。

--- 段落 170 (318 字元) ---
- Q3: Now, clearly the two are logical alternatives: the collapse of the Soviet Union  and [indistinct].But these are two really interesting scenarios that we have to be  prepared to think about.Or was one dominant and the other was not, or one was  dominant in one period and the other was dominant in a later period?

[翻譯]
問題三：現在，顯然這兩者是合乎邏輯的替代方案：蘇聯解體以及[不清晰]。但這兩個情境真的很有趣，我們必須準備好去思考。或者是一個主導而另一個沒有，或是一個在某一時期主導而另一個在後來的時期主導？

--- 段落 171 (233 字元) ---
- Marshall: I would put it this way: In the early ‘80s, on the one hand, you started  to get all this information about the Soviets, and they’re really probably in real  trouble, and they’re pessimistic, and this and that, and so on.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我會這樣說：在80年代初期，一方面，你開始獲得所有有關蘇聯的信息，他們可能真的陷入困境，對未來感到悲觀，等等。

--- 段落 172 (388 字元) ---
On the other hand,  one thing I did have apprehension about was that the Reagan kind of buildup  was too brute force and couldn’t be sustained, that you probably would have  been wiser—which probably was a mistake on my part—that it would have been  better to have tried to have less of a kind of brute-force buildup and try to spend  the money better in the competitive strategies sense.

[翻譯]
另一方面，我對雷根式的軍備建設感到擔憂，覺得那種粗暴的方式無法持久，可能更明智—這可能是我的錯誤—更好的做法應該是試著減少軍備建設的粗暴方式，並在競爭策略上更明智地運用這些資金。

--- 段落 173 (443 字元) ---
Certainly you should have  some buildup, but you probably weren’t going to be able to sustain this kind of  brute force, just-pouring-money-at-it kind of thing.I was concerned about that.Then I think the other thing was that I always felt that U.S.actual military preparations were never very comprehensive or well-balanced.On the upper end, we were  really relying very much on deterrence and that really big wars were never going to  happen.

[翻譯]
當然，你應該有一些積累，但你可能無法維持這種粗暴、只是不停地投資金錢的方式。我對此感到擔憂。我認為另一個問題是，我一直覺得美國的實際軍事准備從來不是非常全面或充分平衡的。在高端方面，我們非常依賴遏制力量，認為大規模的戰爭永遠不會發生。

--- 段落 174 (493 字元) ---
And you might get into a situation where your judgment about that would  change, in which case you’re going to have to undertake really big expenditure  efforts.And we ought to be thinking about that, about how we’re going to do that.I think in some ways we were very lucky, very fortunate that we had this deterrent  focus.And, of course, we were much richer than the Russians, richer than we generally understood at the time.But we were betting a great deal on there not really  being a war.

[翻譯]
有可能你會遇到情況，使得你對於這個判斷會改變，這樣一來你就需要進行非常大的支出。我們應該思考這個問題，我們將如何應對。我認為在某些方面，我們非常幸運，非常幸運我們有這樣一個威懾力量的聚焦。當然，我們比俄羅斯富有得多，比我們當時通常所理解的要富裕。但我們在很大程度上押注於其實沒有真正的戰爭。

--- 段落 175 (248 字元) ---
The Russians, on the other hand, although they certainly wasted a  lot of money, also had far more comprehensive preparations for actually fighting  than we ever did.And it’s one of the sources of our underestimating it, the size of  their efforts.

[翻譯]
然而，俄羅斯人無疑浪費了很多金錢，但他們對實際戰鬥的準備遠比我們做得更全面。這也是我們低估它的來源之一，是他們努力的規模。

--- 段落 176 (315 字元) ---
If you talk to the Germans now, who during much of this period I was trying to tell  that the Russians and the East Germans had various serious preparations and so  on, they relate with surprise what they’ve found as they’ve gotten into discussions and [gained] insight into what the East Germans were really doing.

[翻譯]
如果你現在與德國人交談，我在此期間一直試圖告訴他們俄羅斯和東德人進行了各種嚴肅的準備等事宜，他們會驚訝地與你分享，當他們進行討論並深入了解東德人的真正活動時所發現的。

--- 段落 177 (486 字元) ---
They’re  surprised at the level of readiness that was maintained, at the huge ammunition  stockpiles compared to them; of course, they [the West Germans] had a systematic policy of only buying a few days of ammunition.And they’re surprised at the preparations for early use of nuclear weapons.- Q2: Actual plans for conducting…  
- Marshall: Right, for really conducting war.26 The West Germans didn’t have plans for  really conducting war.- Q2: And even surprised at a technical level.

[翻譯]
他們對保持的準備水準感到驚訝，對比他們擁有的大量彈藥儲備感到驚訝；當然，他們（西德人）採取了只購買少數天彈藥的系統性政策。他們對早期使用核武器的準備感到驚訝。 - Q2：實際進行的計劃… - 馬歇爾：對，真正進行戰爭的計劃。西德人沒有真正進行戰爭的計劃。- Q2：甚至在技術水平上感到驚訝。

--- 段落 178 (498 字元) ---
The West Germans got their hands on  some East German equipment, I think in the armor/anti-armor area.They were  very surprised how it was much more capable, both in terms of armor protection  and in terms of ballistics, than they had thought it was.Now, we for some reason  always figured that the next generation of tank that we put out wasn’t as good as  the next generation that they put out.We always had this “bathtub of ignorance”  in the armor/anti-armor arena, we were always lagging them.

[翻譯]
西德人取得了一些東德的裝備，我認為是在裝甲/反裝甲領域。他們對其在裝甲防護和彈道方面的能力比他們想像的更強大感到非常驚訝。現在，出於某種原因，我們總是認為我們推出的下一代坦克不如他們推出的下一代好。在裝甲/反裝甲領域，我們總是落後於他們，我們總是處於一種“無知的水桶”狀態。

--- 段落 179 (475 字元) ---
The Germans never  ever really quite subscribed to that.And they always kind of thought, well, the  Leopard and Leopard II and all that is keeping pace very well with what they’re  doing on the other side.And then when the collapse came and they got their  hands on it, it wasn’t true, it wasn’t true.They actually did live fires of tank on tank  and Leopard IIs were getting killed and they weren’t able to kill the bad guys.Q3: Just to come back to this USSR endgame stuff.

[翻譯]
德國人從來沒有真正認同這一點。他們總是認為，豹式坦克和豹II坦克等等在與對方同步進展時表現得很出色。當崩潰來臨時，他們拿到了這些資料，才發現這並非事實，他們實際上進行了坦克對坦克的實彈射擊，豹II坦克被擊毀了，但他們無法擊殺敵人。回到蘇聯末日的話題。

--- 段落 180 (397 字元) ---
I was trying to figure out… What  seems to be really useful and unusual and smart about the way you were thinking  about this was that you were really willing to entertain simultaneously outliers on  both sides.- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: That the endgame might be very messy and nasty and violent and you had to  not necessarily spend a lot of money, but you think very hard about that.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
我在試著理解… 你在思考這個問題時，看起來非常有用、不尋常和精明的地方是，你真的很願意同時考慮兩端的離群值。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3：結局可能非常混亂、令人討厭、暴力，你不一定要花很多錢，但你必須非常努力去思考這個問題。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 181 (435 字元) ---
- Q3: But also that it might be extremely advantageous to us, but we could still blow  it if we didn’t think about it.And my problem was always that I would tend to bet  my previous positions, or rather, that I would bet against my fears.I would bet  against the worst outcome and I’d say that’s what we have to plan against.And  not take the upside seriously, so I would never be in a position to exploit opportunities when they came.

[翻譯]
但同時，這對我們可能極其有利，但如果我們沒有思考好，我們仍然有可能失敗。我的問題始終是我會傾向於押我的先前立場，或者說我會押我的恐懼。我會押反最壞的結果，並且說這是我們必須計劃對抗的。並不認真對待好的一面，因此當機會來臨時，我永遠無法利用機會。

--- 段落 182 (403 字元) ---
So that’s useful,  
- Marshall: OK, let’s talk about Goldwater-Nichols as it deals with this office.Goldwater Nichols came along in, what, the middle of ‘86?27  
- Q2: After the Packard Commission.- Marshall: Yeah, right.Well, there are two things.One is, I took the trouble later to try  to understand why the Packard Commission had these recommendations in the  commission report about net assessment.

[翻譯]
所以這是有用的， 
- Marshall：好的，讓我們來談談關於這個辦公室的戈德沃特-尼科爾斯。戈德沃特-尼科爾斯大約在86年中期出現，對吧？
- Q2：帕卡德委員會之後。
- Marshall：是的，沒錯。好吧，有兩點。一個是，我後來花了一些功夫去理解帕卡德委員會為什麼在委員會報告中對凈評估有這些建議。

--- 段落 183 (453 字元) ---
28 According to Gorman, who was on  the Commission, he and Carlucci were the ones who put that in, because they  thought that a broad kind of look at where things were going would be very, very  important and very useful.But what they had in mind when they tasked or suggested that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff come forward with this net  assessment… They did not wish… Since I haven’t talked to Carlucci, maybe this is  just Gorman’s view.

[翻譯]
根據參與委員會的高爾曼所說，他和卡盧奇是那些提出這個建議的人，因為他們認為對事物未來走向進行廣泛的考察非常重要和有用。但當他們要求或建議召集聯合參謀首腦提出這個綜合評估時，他們心中所想的是什麼…他們並未希望…由於我並未與卡盧奇交談，也許這只是高爾曼的觀點。

--- 段落 184 (386 字元) ---
His view was that this was something that should happen at  the beginning of the cycle of setting the budget’s programs.It is something that  should be prepared in a few weeks by the very top-level people, that is, by the  Chairman in consultation with the theater commanders in chief, and should represent their distilled view of what the current situation is, where things were going.

[翻譯]
他的觀點是，這應該是在制定預算方案循環的開始階段發生的事情。這應該在幾周內由最高層人員，即主席在諮詢戰區最高指揮官的情況下準備，並應代表他們對當前情況以及事情的走向的精煉觀點。

--- 段落 185 (494 字元) ---
And then, that should be presented to the President and should assist him in deciding on the budget level that would be laid down for the next couple of years.What happened when that was received over here [the Pentagon], was that the  JCS or the Joint Staff, who had been preparing something that they called a “Risk  Assessment” at the end of the process, would relabel that, rework that, and that  would be the response.So it became a staff document, not the appreciation of  the top people.

[翻譯]
然後，這個應該呈交給總統，並且應該幫助他決定未來幾年預算水平。當這份文件在這裡（五角大廈）接收時，聯合參謀會或聯合參謀部一直在準備一份他們稱為“風險評估”的東西，最終在這個過程中，他們會重新標籤，重新製作，這將成為回應。因此，這成為一份工作人員文件，而不是高層人士的評價。

--- 段落 186 (488 字元) ---
29  One of the things that happened at another level was this Net Assessment  Coordinating Committee was created by Iklé, to be jointly chaired by Iklé and the  Director of the Joint Staff.It was to be, under the initial notion, a place where an  exchange of views could take place between, say, this office and the Joint Staff  representatives about what each one was planning to do, which areas they were  going to be covering, and so on.It met a couple of times and didn’t do anything.

[翻譯]
另一個層面發生的事情是伊克萊創建了這個網路評估協調委員會，由伊克萊和聯合參謀局局長共同擔任主席。最初的構想是讓辦公室和聯合參謀局代表之間進行意見交流，討論各自計劃進行的工作領域等等。這個委員會開了幾次會卻沒有做什麼。

--- 段落 187 (471 字元) ---
It got revived later for very different reasons, essentially to staff the net assessment that would be sent over to the Congress, because the Congress stipulated  that it wanted net assessments.And also there were some net assessment studies  that were tasked to the Department by the Congress, and this was a forum for  deciding who within the Building would answer, and to review what was done.- Q2: A lot of it was driven by Tony Cordesman.30  
- Marshall: Yes, right.

[翻譯]
後來，它因為完全不同的原因而被重新啟動，主要是為了填寫將發送給國會的網路評估，因為國會規定它想要進行網路評估。此外，國會還將一些網路評估研究交由部門負責，這是一個決定大樓內誰會回答的論壇，並且審查已完成的工作。- Q2: 很多都是由托尼·科德斯曼驅動的。
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

--- 段落 188 (470 字元) ---
- Q2: …who kept putting this requirement for net assessments in the law.- Marshall: So they’ve now died off—  
- Q2: Cordesman’s back on Senator John McCain’s staff.- Marshall: —and don’t happen anymore, for the moment anyway.The other thing to talk about the Goldwater-Nichols business is that I think it led,  initially, to kind of delusions of grandeur or competence on the part of the Joint  Staff, who thought they…were going to take over this whole area and so on.

[翻譯]
Q2：...誰一直將這項網路評估要求列入法律中。- 馬歇爾：所以他們現在已經去世了- 
Q2：科德斯曼現在是參議員約翰·麥凱恩的團隊成員。- 馬歇爾：現在，暫時不再發生這種情況。談談關於戈德沃特-尼克爾斯商務的另一件事，我認為它最初引起了聯合參謀的輝煌或能力的錯覺，他們認為...他們將接管整個領域等等。

--- 段落 189 (477 字元) ---
And  it also, I think, was complicated in the initial stages by Admiral William Crowe’s  [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] relations with Weinberger that, I think, were  not very good.In fact, I remember sitting in a meeting with Crowe and talking  with him about these various net assessment problems.In fact, I prepared a paper, I think, at one point for him about what I thought the state of net assessment  was and the kind of things that might be usefully attempted.

[翻譯]
我認為，在初期階段中，由於海軍上將威廉·克羅（聯合參謀總長）與韋恩伯格的關係並不很好，這也讓情況變得更加複雜。事實上，我記得曾與克羅在一次會議上討論這些各種網絡評估問題。事實上，我曾為他準備了一份關於我認為網絡評估狀況以及可能有用嘗試的事情的文件。

--- 段落 190 (442 字元) ---
But I remember him telling me that he wanted to do an assessment of his own,  and he didn’t want the results dictated by politicians and so on.And I don’t know,  on the one hand, he certainly, I think, had some doubts about the competence  of the Joint Staff to really do this sort of thing.On the other hand, he allowed this  Marine colonel, I forget what his…  
- Q2: James Sims.- Marshall: Yeah, Sims, to become overly ambitious and so on.

[翻譯]
但我記得他告訴我，他想要進行自己的評估，並且不想讓結果由政治家等人口述。我不知道，一方面，我認為他對聯合參謀部的能力有些懷疑，真的能夠做這種事情。另一方面，他讓這位海軍陸戰隊上校，我忘了他的名字是... 
- Q2: 詹姆斯辛斯。- 馬歇爾: 是的，辛斯，變得過於雄心勃勃等等。

--- 段落 191 (493 字元) ---
Although it was interesting, I remember being out on the West Coast and receiving a call from Crowe.He was going to have to go up on Capitol Hill to give some sort of presentation  and wanted to know if we could help.And I called back to the office and had people here put together what became his kind of overall assessment of the situation  in the world.That was done overnight for him.- Q2: It’s the only time I’ve ever seen this office go into a crash mode like you see on  the Army Staff.

[翻譯]
儘管這很有趣，我記得當時在西岸，接到克羅的電話。他將不得不前往國會山進行某種演講，想知道我們是否可以幫忙。我打電話回辦公室，讓這裡的人整理出後來成為他對世界狀況的總體評估。這是為了他而通宵完成的。- Q2：這是我唯一一次見到辦公室像陸軍參謀那樣進入緊急模式的情況。

--- 段落 192 (459 字元) ---
Really, it was amazing.Scott Fisher was the Assistant Director at  the time or something.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: And they parsed the whole thing out and gave everybody writing assignments.And we went into this crisis mode, everybody writing a section and bringing it in  and David Epstein editing it and going back out again and all this other stuff.And  we put the thing together in 72 hours or something like that.I think it was a Top  Secret-level document.

[翻譯]
真的，那真是令人驚訝。當時史考特·費雪是助理導演或類似的角色。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：他們將整件事分解出來，並分配寫作任務給每個人。我們進入了危機模式，每個人寫一個部分並帶來，大衛·愛普斯坦進行編輯，然後再出去，等等。我們用了大概72小時左右將這件事完成。我想這是一份機密級的文件。

--- 段落 193 (359 字元) ---
But it’s the kind of thing you always do on a Service staff,  never in this office.And here we were doing this for the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff.And he used it.- Marshall: Yeah, he did.Right.- Q2: It was really the basis for his testimony.31  
- Q3: I’m still kind of puzzled, because I know that Crowe thought very highly of you.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
但這是你們總是在服務人員身上做的事情，從來不會在辦公室裡做。而我們卻為聯合參謀首腦做了這件事。他確實使用了它。- 馬歇爾：是的，他確實使用了。- Q2：這真的成為他證詞的基礎。- Q3：我仍然感到困惑，因為我知道克羅對你的高度評價。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 194 (497 字元) ---
- Q3: Remember that he brought you and Rosen out [indistinct] that East Asian balance when he was CINCPAC [Commander in Chief, Pacific Command]?- Marshall: Yes, right.Well, I don’t know.I was puzzled.I would call him occasionally.I think he thought well of us, and yet I think that one of the bad aspects of the  Goldwater-Nichols Act was that it tended to move the Joint Staff to seal itself off,  to have these kind of ambitions to take over things, which has kind of gone away,  to some extent.

[翻譯]
問題3：記得他在太平洋司令部(CINCPAC)擔任指揮官時，曾將你和羅森帶出東亞的平衡嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，對。嗯，我不知道。我感到困惑。我偶爾會打電話給他。我想他對我們印象良好，但我認為《戈德沃特-尼科爾斯法案》的一個負面方面是，它傾向於使聯合參謀部封閉起來，有這種佔有奪取的企圖心，這在某種程度上已經消失了。

--- 段落 195 (364 字元) ---
32 But there was this initial, as I say, period of delusions of competence.Which is unfortunate that you have to say that in a way, but… right.OK.Maybe the final thing to talk about is the Summer Studies.The motive for that,  in a way, came out of some discussions between Jim Roche and I, and Dennis,  maybe in a minor way, I can’t remember, but mainly Jim and I.

[翻譯]
但說實在的，在一開始有一段自以為是的錯誤誤判時期。不得不這樣說有點不太幸運，但…沒關係。可能最後要談談的是夏季研習。這個想法在某種程度上源自吉姆·羅奇和我之間的一些討論，丹尼斯也可能有些參與，我記不太清楚，但主要是我和吉姆之間的討論。

--- 段落 196 (477 字元) ---
There was this sense  that there weren’t enough young people getting into this business, and there wasn’t  enough communication between various groups—the academics, the people  here in this building, the people on the congressional staffs—and that we would  try to help that through these Summer Studies, and we might get something useful out of it.So we organized, and the first one was held out in Los Angeles at RDA  [Eds: a defense contractor], which kind of organized it.

[翻譯]
有一種感覺，就是這個行業裡缺乏年輕人的參與，各個群體之間的溝通不足——學者、這棟建築中的人們、國會工作人員——我們希望透過這些夏季研究來幫助解決這個問題，希望能從中獲得一些有用的東西。因此，我們進行了組織，第一次是在洛杉磯的RDA [註：一家國防承包商]舉辦。

--- 段落 197 (474 字元) ---
33 This first Summer Study  probably was in ‘85.I don’t know that that’s the right date, it could have been ‘84.The focus of the first one was rather different than the later ones, as I remember  it.There were, I forget, a couple of groups.One of the groups, that I think Dennis  chaired, was to come up with ideas of issues, topics that deserved study, analysis,  and so on.I don’t know.What’s your memory of that?- Q3: Dennis talked about the Middle East.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
這第一個夏季研究可能是在'85年。我不確定這個日期是否正確，可能是在'84年。據我記憶，第一個的焦點和後來的不太一樣。我忘記了，可能有幾個小組。其中一個小組，我想是由丹尼斯主持，是提出值得研究、分析等議題和主題的想法。我不知道。你對此有什麼記憶嗎？-問題3：丹尼斯談到了中東。-馬歇爾：是的。

But there was an effort to kind of catalog a whole bunch of issues.- Q3: No, I remember.His group’s task was to develop a research agenda.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q3: And I must admit—I did the other working group—I can’t for the life of me  remember what that working group did, but I do remember Dennis talking only  about the Middle East in his brief.Marshall: Well, I think both of them were focused on generating agendas, in a way.- Q3: Yeah.

[翻譯]
但有一個努力來整理許多問題。-問題3：不是的，我記得。他的小組任務是制定一個研究議程。-馬歇爾：是的，對。-問題3：我必須承認-我參與了另一個工作小組-我如同大腦當中也想不起那個工作小組做了什麼，但我記得丹尼斯在他的簡報中只談到中東。馬歇爾：嗯，我想他們兩個都專注於生成議程。-問題3：對。

I remember my group sort of did this tour of the horizon focusing on  problems of warring regions, but beyond that I can’t [indistinct].- Q2: If the original ideas was to get young people involved, who did you have involved that’s now a senior-level strategic thinker?- Q3: I don’t know.It was heavier on the academics, because I remember…  
- Marshall: There were a lot of academics, and there were some people from the  RAND Graduate Institute, and then there were a few people from the Congress.

[翻譯]
我記得我們的小組有點像做了一個環球之旅，專注於戰爭地區的問題，但除此之外我實在記不清了。- Q2: 如果最初的想法是讓年輕人參與其中，那麼現在是個高級戰略思想者的是誰參與其中的？- Q3: 我不知道。當時偏向學術層面，因為我記得…- 馬歇爾: 那裡有很多學者，還有一些來自蘭德研究所的人，然後還有一些來自國會的人。

- Q2: Any staffers of note?- Q3: Aaron Friedberg was there, Steve Rosen was there, Steve David was there—  these are all academics, Princeton and Johns Hopkins.I think there were more, a  lot of people from the RAND Graduate School because Charlie Wolf was heavily  involved.And then there were a bunch of Albert’s protégés from Pan Heuristics.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: And there were some guys from the Army.Captain John Rose.A nuclear artillery  guy.

[翻譯]
Q2: 有任何值得注意的工作人員嗎？- Q3: 亞倫·弗里德伯格在那裡，史蒂夫·羅森在那裡，史蒂夫·大衛在那裡—這些都是學者，來自普林斯頓大學和約翰斯·霍普金斯大學。我想那裡還有更多人，許多來自蘭德研究院的人，因為查理·沃爾夫深度參與。然後還有一群阿爾伯特的門生來自Pan Heuristics。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3: 還有一些陸軍的人。約翰·羅斯上尉。一名核炮兵。

- Q2: Yeah, he’s a brigadier general now over in SHAPE [Supreme Headquarters Allied  Powers Europe], in charge of their strategic planning.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: Yeah, he was [indistinct].But I can’t remember any staff guys.- Marshall: I think probably the staff people, maybe…  
- Q3: It was in California, it was hard for them to get there.- Marshall: Yeah, but I think we had one or two.

[翻譯]
-Q2: 對，他現在是SHAPE [歐洲盟軍最高司令部]的一名准將，負責他們的戰略規劃。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2: 是的，他（職銜模糊不清）。但我記不起有哪些參謀人員。- 馬歇爾：我想也許參謀人員中可能......

-Q3: 那是在加州，對他們來說很難到達那裡。- 馬歇爾：是的，但我想我們可能會有一兩個。

- Q3: Yeah, there was one [indistinct].- Marshall: Yeah.And then the next one was up in Newport.We decided that’s a lot  better.And we had also probably the biggest set of people from the Hill.- Q3: Right.Jackie Clegg [indistinct].

[翻譯]
- Q3: 哦，那個最後負責反彈道導彈的那個人... 他在參議院工作，然後他過來了 [聲音不清楚]。
- Marshall: 哦，Brian Dailey嗎？
- Q3: 不是，對不起，我忘記他的名字了。
- Marshall: 無論如何...

- Q3: 對，有一個 [聲音不清楚]。

That was when we did long-range, nonnuclear strikes,  war planning against the Soviet Union involving long-range, nonnuclear strike capa -  bilities and how they could be used to degrade Soviet nuclear capability.That relates  to your [Marshall] point about how the nonnuclear phase affects nuclear capabilities.- Q2: Do you have Henry Sokolski at that next one?- Marshall: I think so, yeah.- Q2: Sokolski, and then there’s this other guy who was a Senator Robert Dole staffer.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
那時我們進行了針對蘇聯的遠程非核打擊、戰爭計劃，涉及長程非核打擊能力以及如何利用這些能力來削弱蘇聯的核能力。這與你（馬歇爾）提到的非核階段如何影響核能力相關。- 問題2：在下一個會議上有沒有亨利·索科爾斯基？- 馬歇爾：我想是的，是的。- 問題2：索科爾斯基，然後還有一個叫羅伯特·多爾參議員工作人員的人。- 馬歇爾：是的。

I forget his name.- Q2: He wasn’t very helpful.He just wanted to go run around Newport.- Marshall: And Janne Nolan was there?- Q2: Not Janne Nolan.The one who went to Harvard to work with Samuel Huntington.Kim Nolan.Kimberly Nolan.- Marshall: Yeah, OK.Then, we didn’t have one in ‘87, because of the meeting in San  Diego connected with the CILTS thing.And we’ve had one every year since then.

[翻譯]
我忘記他的名字。- Q2：他並不是很幫忙。他只是想要去紐波特四處跑跑。- 馬歇爾：然後珍妮·諾蘭在那裡嗎？- Q2：不是珍妮·諾蘭。是那個去哈佛大學和塞繆爾·亨廷頓一起工作的人。金·諾蘭。金伯利·諾蘭。- 馬歇爾：好的。那麼，我們在1987年沒有一個，因為在聖地牙哥的會議中有一個與CILTS事務有關。從那時起，我們每年都有一個。

--- 段落 205 (355 字元) ---
Q2: Well, if the objective is to get young people engaged in this so they’re going to  be set on the right path, so to speak…  
- Marshall: That’s kind of drifted away from that.We’re not doing that so much, I’d  say.It has become more, “OK Here’s a topic.Can we get some really good work  done on it?” as against the emphasis on getting people to mingle.

[翻譯]
問2：如果目標是讓年輕人參與其中，讓他們走上正確的道路，那麼...
- 馬歇爾：這有點偏離了。我想我們沒有太過做這件事。我會這麼說。現在更多地變成了“好，這是一個話題。我們能做一些真正好的工作嗎？”而不是強調讓人們交流。

Now, we still  would like to have gotten more people from the Hill, but since we’re going to the  Naval War College, this first week or so in August fits the best with their schedule  and so on, and that tends to preclude many people from the Hill, because they  haven’t adjourned by that time.

[翻譯]
現在，我們仍然希望從國會山獲得更多人的參與，但因為我們將前往海軍戰爭學院，在八月初的這一周是最符合他們的時間表的，而這樣會排除許多來自國會山的人，因為那時他們還未休會。

--- 段落 207 (468 字元) ---
- Q2: But you know, given what happened in November [‘94 elections], on your next  one, you might really try much harder to get some young people that haven’t  been up there before and don’t know what’s going on.And maybe you ought to  think about, unlike the last couple of these things, really getting some Hill staff up  there that you can start shaping their minds…  
- Q3: [Indistinct] I don’t know exactly how you would do it, but I was talking to Bill  Kristol.

[翻譯]
Q2: 但是你知道，鑑於十一月份發生的事情 [‘94年選舉]，下一次，你可能真的應該更努力地吸引一些從未參與過，并且對發生情況一無所知的年輕人。也許你應該考慮，不像之前這幾次，真的邀請一些山上的工作人員來，你可以開始影響他們的想法…

Q3: [不清楚] 我不確切知道你應該如何做，但我和比爾·克裡斯托爾交談過。

--- 段落 208 (452 字元) ---
Right now, one of the things he’s doing is he’s placing people in House  staff positions.He says that these guys, in 90 percent of the cases, have just no  foreign policy, no defense policy background, nothing.So it’s a chance, an opportunity.- Q4: Something a little tinier than Newport, maybe it could be in the Washington  area [indistinct], if you really wanted to try give them a sense [indistinct], hold it in  Baltimore [indistinct].- Q3: Right.

[翻譯]
現在，他正在做的一件事是安排人們擔任眾議院職位。他說，這些人，在90％的情況下，根本沒有外交政策，也沒有國防政策背景，什麼都沒有。所以這是一個機會。- Q4：也許比紐波特稍微小一點，也許可以在華盛頓地區[不清楚]，如果你真的想要讓他們有點感覺[不清楚]，可以在巴爾的摩舉辦[不清楚]。- Q3：是的。

--- 段落 209 (483 字元) ---
But right now, I mean, there’s just… A lot of them are just trying to figure  out, where’s my desk?How do I make the phones work?And they’re almost exclusively concentrating on the “Contract with America.”  Did you want to talk about the bilats [bilateral talks] at all?Any of those things  worth raising?Any of the…  
- Marshall: I don’t think so, especially.About the only thing that’s new during this  period is we start the arrangements with the Japanese in the last year [1988].

[翻譯]
但現在，我的意思是，有很多人只是試圖弄清楚，我的桌子在哪裡？如何讓電話工作？他們幾乎專注於"美國合約"。你想討論雙邊談判嗎？有哪些值得提出的事情？任何...
- 馬歇爾：我不這麼認為，尤其是在這段時間裡。這段期間唯一新的事情是我們在去年（1988年）與日本人開始安排。

--- 段落 210 (459 字元) ---
That  had come about because of Richard Armitage [Assistant Secretary of Defense for  International Security Affairs], when he more or less replaced Iklé in the last year of the period.He asked me to go and talk with Nishihiro, who was the second  guy in the Japanese Defense Agency, to talk to him about the possibility of some  discussion with them.And then Nishihiro wanted to create something like a net  assessment activity in the Japanese establishment.

[翻譯]
這是由於理查德·阿米塔基（國防部國際安全事務助理部長）提出的建議，他在時期的最後一年更換了伊克勒（Ikle）的位置。他要求我去和日本國防廳的第二人物西廣（Nishihiro）談談，討論與他們進行一些討論的可能性。然後西廣想在日本機構中建立類似於網路評估活動的事物。

--- 段落 211 (407 字元) ---
So we started to do that that  fall, the fall of ‘88.I think I went there initially in August, then we went back in  October, November, something like that.- Q2: We had that one little brief thing with the Brits, where they wanted to start a net  assessment activity.- Marshall: Well, we’ve had a couple of those, three or four of those, with the Brits.But  there’s nothing particularly notable about those.

[翻譯]
所以我們開始在那個秋季，88年的秋季。我想我最初是在八月去的，然後我們在十月、十一月又回去了，類似那樣。- Q2: 我們有一個小小的與英國人的簡短事情，他們想要開始一個網絡評估活動。- 馬歇爾：好吧，我們有幾個這樣的情況，大約三個或四個，與英國人。但這些沒有什麼特別值得注意的地方。

## Outline for 25 January 1995 Talk  
### Reagan second term  
1. Underground command centers/costing of, long history of, mid ‘40s—>  ~1–2% of GNP/part of cost of military power/military burden  
2. Earner/strategic planning activity—maybe mid-’50s/papers in office for Guthe  to look at  — Major theme/part of long-term competition focus of Marshall’s intellectual life

[翻譯]
## 1995年1月25日演講大綱
### 里根的第二任期
1. 地下指揮中心/成本估算，從40年代中期開始的長期歷史 〜1-2%的國內生產總值/ 軍事力量成本的一部分/ 軍事負擔
2. Earner/戰略規劃活動-也許是50年代中期/Guthe辦公室的文件供Guthe查看- 馬歇爾智慧生活的主題的一部分，長期競爭的焦點

--- 段落 213 (282 字元) ---
- Marshall: There are two aspects of the Reagan second term I thought it would be  important to go back and pick up.Maybe the first thing to do would be to do  that, just to add to the earlier discussion.As I thought about it, there were two things that we didn’t really talk about.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我認為重返裡根第二任期中的兩個方面對話很重要。也許首先要做的是回顧這一點，以補充之前的討論。當我考慮這個問題時，有兩件事我們實際上沒有談論到。

--- 段落 214 (322 字元) ---
One  was that in the middle of the Reagan period, in part because Bill Earner was here  in the office, we made another effort in this strategic planning notion that James  Roche and I had first worked on in the middle ‘70s.A number of papers were written and some specific areas, particularly tactical air, were discussed.

[翻譯]
其中一個是在瑞根時期中期，部分是因為比爾·厄納在辦公室裡，我們對該戰略規劃概念進行了另一次努力，這是詹姆斯·羅切和我在70年代中期首次合作完成的。寫了很多文件，也討論了一些特定領域，尤其是戰術空軍。

--- 段落 215 (354 字元) ---
Dick DeLauer  [Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering], who was around at  the time—so this may merge into the last part of the first Reagan term—was very  receptive and we spent a lot of time talking with him.And there are a whole bunch of papers here.There are at least three bound  volumes of various kind of papers that were written.

[翻譯]
在當時出任國防部研究和工程次秘書的狄克·德勞爾（Dick DeLauer），這可能是在里根首個任期的後期時期，非常願意聆聽我們的意見，我們花了很多時間與他交流。這裡有一大堆文件。至少有三卷各種各樣的文件被綁在一起。

--- 段落 216 (322 字元) ---
It also was the background,  in part, for sponsoring research on cost-imposing strategies,35 some continuing  work in that, and things that I think I had Jim Martin do on fleshing out this notion  of long-term competition and strategies for that.36 So there was a whole set of  things that went on that need to be covered.

[翻譯]
同時，這也在某種程度上是贊助成本施加策略研究的背景，一些持續的工作也在進行中，我認為吉姆·馬丁在完善這個長期競爭和相應策略的概念方面進行了一些工作。因此有許多需要被討論的事情。

--- 段落 217 (397 字元) ---
The second thing that I had forgotten to mention was that one of the things that  came out of the shift in the intelligence community’s focus as a result of PD-59  [Presidential Directive 59] was this discovery, which I think was mentioned last  time, of the various protection constructions for the Soviet elite and so on, but  in particular, the underground command centers that were discovered.

[翻譯]
我忘了提及的第二件事是，由於總統指令59號（PD-59）導致情報界關注重心的轉變，其中一件事就是這個發現，我想上次提到過，有關蘇聯菁英等人物的不同保護建築，尤其是發現的地下指揮中心。

--- 段落 218 (398 字元) ---
37 Also  discovered was their very long history, and the Soviet efforts at concealment and,  in fact, active deception that went along with them.38 And one of the things that  we had done, only partially successfully, was a project that was undertaken jointly  for us by the people in intelligence and at the Defense Nuclear Agency to try to  cost this major effort [Soviet underground facilities].

[翻譯]
37 他們的非常悠久歷史也已被發現，蘇聯的隱瞞和實際上的欺騙也被揭露。38 我們曾經做過的一件事，雖然只有部分成功，是由情報界和國防核能機構共同進行的一個項目，試圖估算這項大型努力的成本（蘇聯地下設施）。

--- 段落 219 (468 字元) ---
As I remember, it came out to  be that from the mid‘40s through the mid-‘80s or so, the thing had run at one or  two percent of gross national product, just for that—probably.These are kind of  shaky numbers, but…  
- Q2: Is that the real GNP or the “pseudo” GNP?- Marshall: No, I think the real GNP.- Q2: So this is one or two percent of the overall defense burden, which you thought  was between 25 and 33 percent of GNP.- Marshall: Yeah, right.Or 35 percent of GNP.

[翻譯]
就我所記得的來看，從大約40年代中期到80年代中期左右，國防開支佔了國民生產總值的一到兩個百分點，僅僅是這樣 - 可能是如此。這些數字算是有點不確定的，不過...
- 問題2: 這是真實的國民生產總值還是“偽”國民生產總值？ - 馬歇爾: 不，我認為是真實的國民生產總值。
- 問題2: 所以這個數字是整體國防負擔的一到兩個百分點，你認為它佔國民生產總值的25到33％之間。
- 馬歇爾: 是的，就是這樣。或者是國民生產總值的35%。

--- 段落 220 (491 字元) ---
- Q2: So it was one to two percent out of that.- Marshall: Yeah, right.So it was an enormous effort.- Q3: Was that incorporated into the formal, published estimates of Soviet defense  burdens?- Marshall: No.You see, the Central Intelligence Agency people, I think, never did  these things or didn’t cost them and there was no… I don’t think it’s the kind of  thing they ever really reflected very well in their estimates.- Q3: So they didn’t accept it, even when…  
- Marshall: I don’t know.

[翻譯]
Q2: 所以在那之中只有一到二個百分比。- 馬歇爾：是的。所以這是一個龐大的努力。- Q3: 這是否納入到蘇聯國防開支的正式出版估計中？- 馬歇爾：不是。你看，中央情報局的人，我想，從來沒有做這些事情或者沒有成本，並且沒有…我不認為這是他們在估計中真正很好反映的類型。- Q3: 所以即使在那時他們也沒有接受這一點…- 馬歇爾：我不知道。

’’ Competitive Strategies, 61.- 15 Robert McFarlane claims in his memoirs that during his tenure as President Reagan’s Assistant  for National Security Affairs he viewed the SDI “as a bargaining chip—the President never  would have conceded that, he really meant to build this shield—but that was its primary value  at the time, a means of imposing a fearsome financial burden on the Soviets and leveraging  their behavior at the bargaining table.And this is precisely the effect that SDI had.
