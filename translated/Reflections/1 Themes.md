## Introduction ##  
At the beginning of the interview process in September 1993, Andrew Marshall  met with Kurt Guthe to discuss the book project and the themes Marshall intended  would guide the subsequent interviews.Marshall and Guthe met again in October  1995 when the interviews were complete to discuss and refine the themes they  had intended to explore.

[翻譯]
## 簡介 ##
在1993年9月的面談過程開始時，安德魯·馬歇爾與庫爾特·古特會面討論了書籍計劃以及領導後續面談的主題。馬歇爾和古特在1995年10月再次見面，當時面談已經完成，他們討論並完善了他們打算探索的主題。

--- 段落 2 (423 字元) ---
The editors chose to include both of these sessions as their own chapter: while  the topics in these thematic interviews necessarily duplicate some of the ones  discussed in the chronological chapters, often Marshall describes them in different terms or he adds different nuances to the discussion.Consequently, the  editors concluded that these sessions further illuminate Marshall’s thinking on  a wide variety of issues.

[翻譯]
編輯們決定將這兩個討論單獨列為一章：雖然這些主題訪談中的話題可能會與按時間排序的章節中討論的一些重疊，但馬歇爾通常用不同的術語描述它們，或者在討論中添加了不同的細微差別。因此，編輯們得出結論，這些討論進一步闡明了馬歇爾對各種問題的想法。

--- 段落 3 (424 字元) ---
Any attempt to incorporate the two sessions into the  book’s chronological chapters ran the risk of having to eliminate portions of  the interviews to improve “readability” and continuity.Such an elimination, the  editors felt, would do violence to the overriding principle to record and report  Marshall’s words as delivered during the book project and to provide a complete  primary source document for future generations.

[翻譯]
任何嘗試將這兩個環節納入書籍的時間章節中都面臨著必須刪除訪談的部分以提高“可讀性”和連貫性的風險。編輯們認為，這樣的刪除將違反記錄和報告馬歇爾的原則，即按照書籍計劃中所呈現的方式記錄並記錄他的話語，並為後代提供完整的一手資料文獻。

[翻譯]
在標準分析（軍事）中被忽略的重點是他的優勢（特別是新的），我們的弱點
- 所有這些都難以改變，這意味著可以利用他的弱點。第一個網路評估故事 - 為什麼蘇聯的問題不值得報告; 對弱點的反應。也意味著對我們改善的建議必須考慮實施問題（再次大多數分析都無法提出最好的解決方案 - 大多數系統分析的弱點）

Best to think of situations as involving:  
    — Actors, each with strengths, weaknesses, resources, patterns of behavior,  traits, etc., some of which may have trends of change over time, e.g., differential rates of GNP growth, etc.• Each has goals, strategies (often have to be constructed), memberships in  coalitions, etc.• Context within which actors seek goals, compete  
            −Important factors not under their control, or largely so, e.g.

最好將情況視為涉及：
- 參與者，每個都有優勢、劣勢、資源、行為模式、特質等，其中一些可能隨著時間而變化，例如，國民生產總值增長率差異。
- 每個人都有目標、策略（通常需要構建）、組成聯盟等。
- 參與者在競爭中尋求目標的背景。
- 重要因素不在他們的控制之下，或很大程度上如此。

### Themes 1
- Marshall: I think that of the next couple of times that we meet, probably one session ought to be devoted to getting ready for the meeting that’s at the end of  October [29 Oct 1993], and the other one could be almost an interview—I could  make some notes, you could create some questions on my early background  or antecedents, and then maybe you could undertake to take whatever is said  there and suggest how a chapter might be organized and then you could try to  put something together.

[翻譯]
### 主題1
- 馬歇爾：我認為在我們接下來幾次見面中，可能應該有一次會專注於準備在十月底舉行的會議上[1993年10月29日]，另一次可以近乎是一次訪談—我可以做一些筆記，你可以準備一些關於我早期背景或根源的問題，然後也許你可以試著提出如何組織一章節，然後你可以嘗試寫一些東西。

--- 段落 20 (482 字元) ---
But for today, we can just talk about these intellectual  themes.So maybe I should just start.OK.I just have numbered them, and the first one—they occurred somewhat  chronologically—is this importance of resource constraints and the macroeconomic perspective on many of these national security issues.It seemed to me to  be a central theme of things I’ve been involved in.Very early on at RAND—once  I’d gotten out to Santa Monica—I was involved in this so-called “criteria problem.

[翻譯]
但是今天，我們可以只是談論這些智力主題。所以也許我應該開始了。我只是列了數字，第一個-它們在某種程度上是按時間順序排列的-是資源限制的重要性，以及對許多國家安全議題的宏觀經濟觀點。對我來說，這似乎是我參與的事情的一個核心主題。在 RAND 的早期階段-一旦我到了聖塔莫尼卡-我就參與了這個所謂的“標準問題”。

--- 段落 21 (301 字元) ---
”2  One of the things that economists were put to work on and one of the reasons  that economists were brought to RAND was because it was thought that the  RAND Corporation ought to have some economists to address this so-called “criteria,” “military worth” issue.Clearly, resources were part of that.

[翻譯]
2 經濟學家受聘並被引入蘭德公司的原因之一，是因為人們認為蘭德公司應該有一些經濟學家來解決所謂的「標準」、「軍事價值」問題。顯然，資源是其中的一部分。

--- 段落 22 (409 字元) ---
And one of the  things that came up very early was that the engineers, who until that time had  dominated all the studies, often made kind of intellectual mistakes in organizing  or specifying the criteria.They also had some odd beliefs that the budgets or the  dollars were just some arbitrary, bureaucratically imposed obstacle that they [the  budgets] didn’t have anything intrinsic to do with the problem.

[翻譯]
有一件事早期就開始浮現，那就是工程師們在過去主導所有研究的情況下，常常在組織或規定標準時犯了一些智力上的錯誤。他們還有一些奇怪的信念，認為預算或金錢只是一些任意的、被官僚強加的障礙，與問題本身沒有任何內在聯繫。

--- 段落 23 (376 字元) ---
So one of the  things early on was to try to persuade the engineers that budgets and dollars  reflected resources, and they reflected choices that they were making, and that  the costs in the macroeconomic sense were real.Another way that this resource constraint issue matters or got involved was in  the thinking about the ways to improve our forecasting of Soviet programs.

[翻譯]
所以早期的一個事情是嘗試說服工程師，預算和金錢反映資源，反映他們正在做出的選擇，以及從宏觀經濟角度來看成本是真實的。資源限制問題的另一個重要性或參與是在思考如何改進我們對蘇聯計劃的預測方式時。

--- 段落 24 (335 字元) ---
3  One of the problems had been that people made forecasts of how many missiles  they could build, how many bombers, how many this or whatever it was, and  there was no sense that if you added all the programs together maybe they [Eds:  program costs] just outran all resources that they [Eds: Soviets] could possibly  put into things.

[翻譯]
其中一個問題是，人們預測他們可以建造多少飛彈、多少轟炸機，以及可能有多少資源投入各種計畫，但他們沒有意識到，如果將所有計畫加在一起，也許支出可能會超過蘇聯可能投入的所有資源。

--- 段落 25 (393 字元) ---
So one of the proposals that we made—and something I think  some other people at the Agency were interested in toward the late ‘50s—was to  begin costing out programs as best you could and then looking at what everything added up to.4 That was, in some sense, the initial motive of the development of the costing of the military program that was undertaken by the Central  Intelligence Agency.

[翻譯]
因此，我們提出的其中一項建議──我認為在晚50年代時，機構中有其他一些人對此也感興趣──是盡力評估計劃成本，然後查看所有加總出來的內容。在某種程度上，這是進行軍事計劃成本核算的動機，這項工作是由中央情報局進行的。

--- 段落 26 (220 字元) ---
But anyway, that notion that overall resources are limited  and need to be thought about arose in this context of trying to do a better job of  forecasting and looking at the trade-offs the Soviets themselves would face.

[翻譯]
但無論如何，對於整體資源有限且需要深思熟慮的這種觀念是在試圖更好地預測和研究蘇聯自身將面臨的取捨時出現的。

--- 段落 27 (624 字元) ---
Related to that is this whole notion of the military burden, and especially the  importance of looking at that not only for our own side—which we didn’t pay a  lot of attention to, that is, people like Joseph Loftus and I—but from the Soviet  side, because they were so obviously outspending us as a percentage of gross national product, and this meant in the long term that this would cause problems,  difficulties for them, that they could do so only with penalties in terms of either  current consumption or of investment, and that either one would, in the end,  cause some problems to them, as turned out to be the case.

[翻譯]
與此相關的是軍事負擔的整個概念，特別是重要性，不僅要從我們自己的角度來看（我們沒有給予過多關注，即像約瑟夫·洛夫塔斯和我們這樣的人），還要從蘇聯的角度來看，因為他們在國民生產總值的百分比上顯然花費比我們多，這在長期來看將導致問題，對他們造成困難，他們只能以當前消費或投資為代價才能這樣做，而最終將對他們造成問題，情況就是如此。

--- 段落 28 (307 字元) ---
Later, my own interest in this issue was very much the source of my interest in  the health care and pollution side of things in the Soviet Union.That is one of  the reasons I started Murray Feshbach off…Well, the sequence was Feshbach’s  demography work showed this change in the life expectancy of people.

[翻譯]
後來，我對這個問題的興趣很大程度上促使了我對蘇聯的醫療保健和污染方面的興趣。這也是我讓穆雷·費希巴赫開始進行研究的原因之一...嗯，事情的順序是費希巴赫的人口統計工作顯示了人們預期壽命的變化。

--- 段落 29 (293 字元) ---
First, I  guess, it was just the increase in, I suppose, the late ‘60s, early ‘70s, the death rates  from certain diseases, increased infant mortality, a variety of things, coupled with  the changing ethnic balance in the Soviet Union, interested me in the problem of  the future demographics.

[翻譯]
首先，我猜想，大概是在60年代末、70年代初，某些疾病的死亡率增加，嬰兒死亡率上升，種種原因，再加上蘇聯不斷變化的族群結構，使我對未來人口統計的問題產生興趣。

--- 段落 30 (330 字元) ---
But the thing that I thought would have the biggest impact in the end was this  underinvestment in health care and the health of the population, because ultimately the population, its vigor… In the first place, just its vigor and vitality might  be undermined and that would weigh on the long-term competitiveness of the  Soviets.

[翻譯]
但我認為最終對影響最大的是對醫療和人民健康的投資不足，因為最終，人口的活力...首先，就是它的活力和活力可能會受損，這將影響蘇聯的長期競爭力。

--- 段落 31 (381 字元) ---
But in addition, it meant that when they tried to correct these problems,  a new claimant of overall resources would surface and compete in some way  or another with the defense expenditures.And also, this was something that  couldn’t be ignored in perpetuity, because the people themselves, I think, would  eventually see that their health status relative to others would decline.

[翻譯]
但是，這也意味著，當他們試圖解決這些問題時，一個新的主張整體資源的人將出現並以某種方式與國防支出競爭。而且，這也是一個不能永遠被忽視的問題，因為我認為，人們最終會意識到他們相對於他人的健康狀況會下降。

--- 段落 32 (349 字元) ---
In fact, at  one time I tried to get the Voice of America to start broadcasting stuff like, “Did  you know that your life expectancies have gone down?” and so on.But I couldn’t  persuade them to do it.I think it was stupid on their part.- Q1: Why [Eds: wouldn’t VOA agree to broadcast]?- Marshall: I don’t know, they just seemed indifferent to this.

[翻譯]
事實上，曾經有一段時間，我嘗試讓美國之聲開始廣播類似「你知道你的預期壽命已經下降了嗎？」等內容。但我無法說服他們這樣做。我認為這是他們愚蠢的舉動。問1：為什麼【編者：美國之聲不同意廣播】？馬歇爾：我不知道，他們似乎對此漠不關心。

--- 段落 33 (450 字元) ---
The pollution stuff, I think, again, is another big thing where they have underinvested, in the control of pollution, and are going to pay a price for the next 100  years that will be higher in terms of higher expenses, people [indistinct].And it’s  those kinds of failures of investment that create semi-permanent handicaps.Alright, so I had the sense that these resource constraints are very important and  had to be thought about in these matters.

[翻譯]
我認為，污染問題是另一個他們投資不足的大問題，對於控制污染，他們將會支付未來100年更高的代價，這將會轉化為較高的支出，對人們造成不明顯的風險。這些投資失敗將造成半永久的障礙。所以我覺得這些資源限制是非常重要的，必須在這些問題上加以考慮。

--- 段落 34 (342 字元) ---
Just one anecdote: in the competitive  strategies stuff, one of the ideas was this notion of cost-imposing strategies.It  was interesting that one of the really most intelligent military officers, a man who  was then the Chief of Staff of the Air Force [Lew Allen, Chief of Staff, 1978–82],  wasn’t sure about this, that it was a viable idea.

[翻譯]
只是一個軼事：在競爭策略方面，其中一個想法是將成本施加在對手身上。有趣的是，當時美國空軍參謀長（1978-1982年）是一位非常聰明的軍官，他對這個想法不太確定，認為這是否是一個可行的概念。

--- 段落 35 (362 字元) ---
First, because his view was that  if we do something and we increase the amount of money they have to put into  the appropriate counters in the defense area, they would simply always find the  resources.In other words, that there were, in a real-life sense, endless resources  available to them.The long-term consequences were not, I think, part of his thinking.

[翻譯]
首先，因為他的觀點是，如果我們採取某些行動並增加他們必須投入防禦領域的計數器中的金額，他們將總是能夠找到資源。換句話說，在現實生活中，他們可以無限取用資源。我認為，他沒有考慮到長期後果。

--- 段落 36 (290 字元) ---
And the second thing, which was a good reason, was that we might start  something that we wouldn’t stick with and so we would stimulate activities on  their side which we weren’t prepared ourselves to counter and to deal with.And  that’s a very legitimate concern.6 | Chapter 1: Themes  OK.

[翻譯]
而第二個原因，也是一個很好的理由，是我們可能開始一些我們無法堅持下去的事情，因此我們會刺激他們方面的活動，而我們自己卻沒有準備好去對抗和應對。這是非常合理的擔憂。。

--- 段落 37 (431 字元) ---
The second intellectual theme, I would say, is that the opponent is not a fixed  thing, that is, that you can’t proceed by making a forecast of what the opponent is  likely to do over any extended period of time and then plan against that.Because  his responses… He’s not fixed in any particular shape.He has some constants limiting what he does, but not towards the… And even using several alternatives is  not fully satisfactory.

[翻譯]
我想說的第二個智力主題是對手並非固定的事物，也就是說，你不能通過對對手在任意延長時間內可能會做什麼做出預測，然後制定對策。因為他的反應...他並不固定在任何特定的形狀上。他有一些固定的限制在他所做的事情上，但不是朝著...即使使用幾種替代方案也不完全滿意。

--- 段落 38 (311 字元) ---
On the other hand, I think one of the early mistakes at RAND was the tendency  to assume the worst about the opponent.The thing that made game theory and  the minimax kind of philosophy fail in the end is that it’s wrong to, in some sense,  assume the worst—that he will be the most rational, flexible opponent.

[翻譯]
另一方面，我認為蘭德研究中心的早期錯誤之一是傾向於對對手持悲觀態度。導致博弈理論和極小化最大化哲學最終失敗的原因是，在某種意義上，假設對手將是最理性、靈活的對手是錯誤的。

--- 段落 39 (476 字元) ---
And this  led to a great interest on my part in trying to understand the character of other  states, the needs of opponents, the social-cultural factors that influence their  behavior, their choices, their [indistinct].Also, I came to understand that history  affects their viewpoint, but more than that, leads to their organizations having  certain characters, certain structures, which themselves perpetuate certain kinds  of behavior, certain kinds of processes, and so on.

[翻譯]
這引發了我對試圖理解其他州的特性、對手的需求、影響他們行為、選擇和文化社會因素的極大興趣。我也開始明白歷史影響他們的觀點，更重要的是，導致他們的組織具有特定的性格、結構，這些本身會延續特定類型的行為、過程等等。

--- 段落 40 (484 字元) ---
A related theme is that you need in your analysis and your thinking to take  account of his weaknesses and your strengths, which tends not to be the way at  least the bulk of American analysis has tended to proceed.It focuses a lot more on  our weaknesses and new or possible strengths that he might have.Clearly, you’ve  got to take account of that, but the actual functioning of analysis tends to have a  blind spot with respect to the opponent’s weaknesses and how to exploit them.

[翻譯]
一個相關的主題是，在你的分析和思考中，你需要考慮他的弱點和你的優勢，這往往不是至少大部分的美國分析所遵循的方式。它更多地專注於我們的弱點和他可能擁有的新的或可能的優勢。顯然，你必須考慮這一點，但實際的分析運作傾向於忽視對手的弱點以及如何利用它們。

--- 段落 41 (424 字元) ---
Some of our strengths, or his weaknesses—our strengths in particular—come  about because of special competences that are created by past investments, by  past history and experiences.For example, all of the skills involved in aircraft carrier operations would probably take anybody starting from scratch 15 or 20 years  to fully reproduce.So many of these strengths are the results of investment or  they’re social-cultural.

[翻譯]
我們的一些優勢，或者說他的弱點 ─ 我們特別是我們的優勢 ─ 是由過去的投資、歷史和經驗所帶來的特殊能力造就的。例如，參與航空母艦操作所需的所有技能，從零開始可能需要15到20年才能完全複製。因此，這些優勢很多是投資的結果，或者是社會文化的。

I was very struck at one point by Michel Crozier’s book—I think called The  Bureaucratic Phenomenon—where he showed how different cultures lead to different kinds of organizations and different kinds of relations within organizations  of superiors and subordinates.He showed how these things are very related to  deeply rooted cultural things that relate, for example, specifically to this whole  matter of how—right from childhood—superiors treat subordinates and so on.

[翻譯]
有一次，我非常受到米歇爾·克羅澤（Michel Crozier）的一本書（我想這本書叫做《官僚現象》）的影響，他在書中展示了不同文化如何導致不同類型的組織及組織中上下級之間不同類型的關係。他展示了這些事物如何深深地與根深蒂固的文化事物相關，比如，這整個問題與上級如何從孩童時期開始對待下屬等等。

--- 段落 43 (477 字元) ---
The whole set of relationships that are inherent in the particular culture get reproduced in many ways in the organizations.5 This means, among other things, that  Soviet command-and control systems are Russian; the relationship of superiors  and subordinates is very, very different than in the United States and most other  Western countries.Again, all of this is ignored in the standard analysis—well, that’s repeating—I mean  it tends to emphasize the opponent’s strengths.

[翻譯]
特定文化中固有的整套關係方式在組織中以多種方式重現。這意味著，蘇聯的指揮和控制系統是俄羅斯式的；上級和下級之間的關係與美國和大多數其他西方國家非常不同。再次強調，這一切在標準分析中被忽略了—這意味著它傾向於強調對手的優勢。

--- 段落 44 (366 字元) ---
Especially the intelligence community tends to focus on new strengths that he might create by buying X, Y, and Z.The thing to note, I think, in a way, is that this means that these strengths [and]  weaknesses are very hard to change on both sides, which led me, on the one hand, to feel that this usual contrast between capabilities and intentions was  not adequate.

[翻譯]
尤其是情報界往往專注於他可能通過購買X、Y和Z所創造的新實力。我認為需要注意的一點是，這意味著這些實力和弱點很難在雙方都改變，這讓我一方面覺得這種通常的能力和意圖之間的對比是不夠充分的。

--- 段落 45 (404 字元) ---
Because the tendency is to see capabilities as relatively fixed and,  therefore, intelligence people should focus on them, whereas intentions or the  behavioral sorts of things could rapidly change.And there’s some truth in that,  but the fact is that behavior in many ways is also very hard to change, or the way  you would fight, or the performance of your organizations, is very, very hard to  change.

[翻譯]
因為人們往往認為能力相對固定，因此智慧的人應該專注於它們，而意圖或行為方面的事情可能會迅速改變。這部分是有道理的，但事實是，在很多方面行為也是很難改變的，例如你的戰鬥方式，或者你的組織表現，都非常難以改變。

--- 段落 46 (462 字元) ---
It’s not a matter of what kind of weapons you own, but the skills, the  capacities of these organizations.And, yes, with a new leadership, they could  change their views and the decision to go to war or not go to war might change,  but how they would fight, how they would behave, in many other ways is far  more fixed than this intentions-versus-capabilities simple paradigm suggests.As I said, the intelligence community does not focus very much on weaknesses.

[翻譯]
不在於你擁有什麼樣的武器，而是這些組織的技能和能力。是的，有了新的領導層，他們可能改變他們的觀點，決定是否發動戰爭，但他們將如何戰鬥，如何行事，在許多其他方面遠比意圖和能力這種簡單的範式所暗示的更為固定。正如我所說，情報機構並不太關注弱點。

--- 段落 47 (463 字元) ---
The first net assessment that was done was started when I was still at the National  Security Council staff, then I changed and moved to the Pentagon in the middle  of it, and when it came to the end of the study effort, the intelligence people had  been asked to talk about the strengths and weaknesses of the Soviet ground  forces.And the initial [Defense Intelligence Agency] position was that there were  no weaknesses.Then you asked them, “How could that be?

[翻譯]
第一次進行的淨評估是在我仍在國家安全委員會工作人員時開始的，然後我在進行中轉移到五角大樓，當研究工作接近尾聲時，情報部門被要求談論蘇聯陸軍的優勢和弱點。最初的國防情報局立場是沒有弱點。然後你問他們，“這怎麼可能呢？

--- 段落 48 (436 字元) ---
” Their argument was,  “Well, if they have a problem, they will notice it and fix it.So it’s not worthwhile  taking account of it in any real planning.” I guess it was at that point that I said,  “Would that we were like that.” But Lt.Gen.Danny Graham, who was the head of  DIA at that point, when I explained the thing to him said, “Nonsense,” and went on  and developed a list of weaknesses.This episode is symptomatic of the problem.

[翻譯]
他們的論點是：“如果他們有問題，他們會注意到並解決它。因此，在任何真正的計劃中考慮它是不值得的。” 我想就在那時，我說：“要是我們也這樣就好了。” 但當時擔任DIA主管的Lt.Gen.Danny Graham，在我向他解釋這件事時說：“胡說八道”，並列出了一份弱點清單。這一事件象徵著問題的本質。

--- 段落 49 (406 字元) ---
Another implication of all of this is that recommendations about new, good  things that we should do to improve our posture, our performance, must take  into account the problems of implementation by the organizations that are being  asked to change.And again, most analysis does not deal with this at all, and tends  to put forth abstract best solutions.This is another weakness of most systems  analysis.

[翻譯]
所有這一切的另一個涵義是，關於新的、有益的事物推薦，我們應該如何改善我們的姿勢、我們的表現，必須考慮到組織在要求改變時面臨的實施問題。再次強調，大多數分析根本未處理這個問題，傾向提出抽象的最佳解決方案。這是大多數系統分析的另一個弱點。

--- 段落 50 (411 字元) ---
When I was working in the mid ‘60s on this whole problem of organizational behavior and drew attention to this point, the notion was coined of “the  missing chapter” [in RAND reports], that never really dealt with this very serious  implementation problem.6  Alright, a third theme is a kind of model of how you ought to think about these  situations that are typical in military and national security analysis.

[翻譯]
當我在60年代中期致力於組織行為問題並引起人們對這一點的關注時，提出了“缺少的一章”這個概念，從未真正處理這個非常嚴重的實施問題。第三個主題是一種關於如何思考在軍事和國家安全分析中典型情況的模型。

--- 段落 51 (388 字元) ---
That is, that the  whole structure of the situation should be seen as follows: there are actors—at  one level they could be states, at another level they could be separate military  organizations within states.The actors each have strengths, weaknesses, a stream  of resources that supports them, patterns of behavior that come from their history, the culture that they are in, and so on.

[翻譯]
亦即，整個情況結構應該被視為如下：有行動者，他們可能是國家，在另一層面他們可能是國家內部的獨立軍事組織。這些行動者都有各自的優勢、劣勢、支持他們的資源流、來自歷史的行為模式、所處文化等等。

--- 段落 52 (466 字元) ---
Some of these things may change  gradually over time and be affected, for example, by differential rates of GNP  growth in particular countries.Also, each of these actors has its goals and its  strategies for attaining those goals.And in this sense, all of the actors need to be  treated entirely symmetrically.Then these actors are set within a context within which they seek to attain their  goals and to compete among one another, or to form coalitions, whatever.

[翻譯]
這些事情有些可能會逐漸隨著時間改變，受到不同國家國民生產總值增長速度的影響。此外，每個參與者都有自己的目標和達成目標的策略。在這個意義上，所有參與者需要被完全對待對稱。然後這些參與者被置於一個背景之中，他們在該背景下努力實現自己的目標，並進行競爭，或組建聯盟，不論是什麼。

--- 段落 53 (461 字元) ---
This context has to be described in terms of factors that are important to the analysis,  but not really under the control of any of the actors, or largely are so.These factors  may include most aspects of technology.The demographics of even their own societies are seldom under the control of the leaders of countries.Climate is another factor.For example, Joe Fletcher makes a good case that there are something like 140-year  cycles in the climate right now.

[翻譯]
這個背景必須根據對分析重要的因素進行描述，但實際上不受任何行動者控制，或大多數情況下如此。這些因素可能包括技術的大多數方面。即使是他們自己社會的人口統計數據也很少受到國家領導人的控制。氣候是另一個因素。例如，喬·弗萊徹（Joe Fletcher）提出了一個很好的觀點，即目前氣候中存在著約140年的循環。

--- 段落 54 (381 字元) ---
Also there could emerge new viruses, other organisms, new plagues.7 These factors represent the changing character of the context.It’s that way of thinking about things, the structure of the problems, that is very,  very important.In some ways, this is related to the earlier theme of, essentially,  the opponent isn’t fixed.You can’t just project his behavior and plan against it.

[翻譯]
同時，也可能出現新的病毒、其他生物體、新的瘟疫。這些因素代表著環境的變化特性。這種思考方式，問題的結構，非常非常重要。從某種意義上說，這與早期談到的主題有關，基本上，對手並不是固定的。你不能只是推測他的行為然後對此進行計劃。

--- 段落 55 (330 字元) ---
And then, the issue is on the strategies and other things that would determine  the interaction between the opponents and the evolution of the state description  of other [paths?]  A fourth theme in my life is the importance in many, if not most cases of looking  at particular issues, within this long-term competition framework.

[翻譯]
然後，問題在於決定對手之間互動和其他事情的策略，以及其他[途徑?]狀態描述的演變。我生命中的第四個主題是，在許多情況下，如果不是大多數情況下，在這個長期競爭框架內看待特定問題的重要性。

--- 段落 56 (446 字元) ---
While there was  some of this kind of a framework that characterized some of the very early thinking that I was exposed to at RAND,8 and certainly related to the sort of thinking  that stemmed from George Kennan’s analysis of Russia, the thing that I noticed  when I resurrected it and formulated it in a way more adapted to thinking about  the analysis of national security issues in the late ‘60s was the change of perspective that it gave you.

[翻譯]
在蘭德公司初期思維中，有一些這種特徵的框架，這與喬治·肯南對俄羅斯的分析相關聯，當我重新提出這一框架並將其應用於晚期60年代的國家安全問題分析時，我注意到它給你帶來的觀點變化。

--- 段落 57 (385 字元) ---
9 That is, this focus on the need to think through a strategy  for competing over an extended period of time forced attention to, first, a complex set of goals that you really have in such a competition, which, again, often is  ignored in the standard analysis, which tends to try to search for quantification,  to narrow down the criteria to things that can be focused on in analysis.

[翻譯]
換句話說，這種專注於需要設定長期競爭策略的焦點，強迫注意首先是在這樣的競爭中你真正擁有的一套複雜目標，這在標準分析中往往被忽略，該分析傾向於尋求量化，將標準繁多的標準縮小到可以在分析中專注的事物。

--- 段落 58 (374 字元) ---
It then  relegates what most people focus attention on, that is, some specific decision  or program, to being really a move in the implementation of a strategy in some  extended competition.That together, at least for me, just transformed the way you ought to look at  many issues, and I think, in some ways, has been really very central to a lot of my  thinking ever since.

[翻譯]
然後，它將大多數人關注的重點，也就是某些具體的決策或計劃，歸納為實施某種擴展競爭策略的一部分。對我來說，這至少改變了你應該看待許多問題的方式，並且我認為，在某種程度上，這真的已成為我思考許多問題的核心。

--- 段落 59 (377 字元) ---
And this thing itself stemmed from the work on trying to  look at the Russians and understand them, which led to this focus on not only  this resource issue, the constraints, but on the fact…[gap due to tape change] …  focuses attention on the multiplicity of goals that you have to think about, trade  off, to some extent, in making your decisions.That’s maybe the wrong time.

[翻譯]
而這件事本身源自對俄羅斯進行研究並了解他們的工作，這使我們不僅專注於資源問題、限制，還關注事實……引起了對你必須考慮、權衡、在做決定時得思考的多重目標的關注。這可能是錯誤的時機。

--- 段落 60 (389 字元) ---
I was talking about the organizational thing, which  then led me not only to the Carnegie-Mellon University focus on the limited  rationality of decision-making of organizations, but also to the Harvard Business  School people, who were trying to characterize and understand organizations as  having themselves strategies for competing and succeeding in the environment  that they were in.

[翻譯]
我當時談論的是組織事務，這讓我不僅引向了卡內基梅隆大學對組織決策有限理性的研究重點，也引向哈佛商學院的人們，他們試圖描述並理解組織本身在競爭和成功環境中的策略。

--- 段落 61 (195 字元) ---
10 And indeed, that one of the critical factors in the management  of a large organization was the correct specification of a strategy, which could  then guide other kinds of decisions and so on.

[翻譯]
而事實上，管理大型組織中的一個關鍵因素是正確明確定戰略，這樣才能引導其他種類的決策等等。

--- 段落 62 (381 字元) ---
So it meant that when one looked at a particular area, like the strategic nuclear  systems and strategic warfare, intellectually you ought to think about what our strategy for competing in that area was, and then, from that, you would get a  clearer picture of how to think about specific choices, like this bomber versus that  bomber, or how many, the whole complex set of issues.

[翻譯]
這意味著，當人們看著特定領域時，例如戰略核系統和戰略戰爭，你應該從智力上思考我們在該領域競爭的策略，然後，從中獲得更清晰的想法來思考具體的選擇，比如這種轟炸機對那種轟炸機，或是有多少，整個複雜的問題集。

--- 段落 63 (500 字元) ---
It’s also kind of related to  some of the things that Jim Roche and Barry Watts raise in their criticism of measures of effectiveness [“Choosing Analytic Measures”].11 That, again, if you look at  real life, you see that particular moves or actions that one takes have a very complex set of consequences far beyond the kind of things that are reflected in these  measures of effectiveness that narrow things down, are very reductionist, and  tailored to try to allow quantitative analysis to proceed.

[翻譯]
這也與吉姆·羅奇（Jim Roche）和巴里·沃茨（Barry Watts）在對有效性度量方法的批評中提出的一些問題有關[“選擇分析度量”]. 再者，如果您看真實生活，您會發現某些特定的舉措或行動會引發一連串非常複雜的後果，遠遠超出這些有效性度量方法所反映的範圍。這些方法將事物簡化、過度紮實，並且旨在讓量化分析能夠進行。

--- 段落 64 (334 字元) ---
A next theme for me, I think, has been the importance of the nonrational aspects  of man.Now, some of this is reflected in this interest in organizational behavior  and limited rationality, the limited rationality not only of organizations, but of  human beings themselves, who can’t be fully rational in that there’s too much to  do.

[翻譯]
我認為對我來說，下一個主題的重要性就在於人類的非理性層面。這在對組織行為和有限理性的興趣中表現出來，這種有限的理性不僅體現在組織中，也體現在人類自身，因為人類無法完全理性地處理所有事務。

--- 段落 65 (489 字元) ---
Then there’s the aspect that comes from ethology, where you see that man  is simply another animal, and is not fully rational, his action, his behavior is not  dominated by the rational part of him.Indeed, Lionel Tiger’s made the point  that man is an “action animal,” he is not a “thinking animal.” Man was designed to  survive in the jungle, where quick and reasonably astute decisions are what are  important.In some sense, we’re living in a period where a new model of man is emerging.

[翻譯]
然後還有從動物行為學而來的觀點，您會看到人類只是另一種動物，並不完全理性，他的行為並不被他的理性部分所支配。事實上，Lionel Tiger指出人類是一種"行動動物"，而不是"思考動物"。人類被設計來在叢林中生存，這裡迅速和相當敏銳的決策是重要的。從某種意義上說，我們正在生活在一個新的人類模型正在浮現的時期。

--- 段落 66 (311 字元) ---
Most intellectuals hate it because it does not accord as high a place to rationality,  and it raises what seems to be the issue or the insight that in some ways a lot or  some significant part of the responses of man to situations are “hardwired” and  have been placed there through the course of his evolution.

[翻譯]
大多數知識分子討厭這個現象，因為它並未如同理性一樣佔據高位，並且引發了一個看似問題或洞見：某種程度上，人類對情況的大部分或一些重要反應是「硬連結」，在進化過程中已經被安排好了。

--- 段落 67 (407 字元) ---
I was talking once  with Daniel Kahneman, the very interesting psychologist, who made the point  that if you look at the eye, sight is, through evolution, one of the most elaborated and perfected of our senses.You can see when you look at the eye and  understand it in more detail how it is kind of layer after layer of adjustments and  adaptation to reach this level of accuracy and precision that we have.

[翻譯]
我曾經與非常有趣的心理學家丹尼爾·卡尼曼談過，他指出如果你觀察眼睛，視覺是透過演化中最精密和完善的感官之一。當你觀察眼睛並更詳細地了解它時，你會看到這是一層一層的調整和適應，為了達到我們現在所擁有的準確度和精確度。

--- 段落 68 (337 字元) ---
His notion  was that the rational, the thinking part of man was still evolving and [had] not  fully reached the state which sometime it will.You just have to look at the work  of Kahneman and Amos Tversky to see how fallible man’s thinking is, the kind of  mistakes, from a purely rational perspective, that the mind is inclined to make.

[翻譯]
他的觀點是，人類理性和思考的部分仍在進化中，尚未完全達到有時將會達到的狀態。你只需看看卡尼曼和阿莫斯·特沃斯基的研究，就可以看到人類思考是多麼容易出錯，純粹理性角度而言，人的頭腦往往會犯的那種錯誤。

--- 段落 69 (461 字元) ---
12  And then you look at the work of Michael McGuire and these people on one  of man’s nearer relatives—where the most detailed work has been done—the  vervet monkey.13 You see how the whole blood chemistry changes by the social  status of the animal.I mean dominant animals have much higher serotonin levels  and so on.There even is some reason to believe their mental functioning is different.And we know that in other animals we have similar kinds of things.

[翻譯]
然後你看看邁克爾·麥圭爾和其他學者對於人類更接近親屬之一——綠猴的研究。你會看到動物的社會地位如何改變整個血液化學物質。我指的是，支配性動物擁有更高的血清素水平等等。甚至有理由相信它們的思維功能是不同的。而我們也知道在其他動物身上有類似的現象。

--- 段落 70 (317 字元) ---
Perhaps  the most dramatic is a story about a lizard, which we can get into.14 And there  have been some tests on humans.Although, again, humans are frightened by  and don’t want to know about some of these things, but it’s clear that the blood  chemistry of humans is, to some extent, related to their social status.

[翻譯]
也許最引人注目的是有關一隻蜥蜴的故事，我們可以深入探討。曾對人類進行了一些測試。再者，人類對某些事物感到害怕並不想知道，但顯然人類的血液化學在某種程度上與其社會地位有關。

--- 段落 71 (476 字元) ---
The importance of understanding, taking account of what are the nonrational aspects of  man and his behavior then leads to this interest in the analysis of what in the ‘70s  began to be called “perceptions,” that is, perceptions versus reality.This is central to understanding, say, the political use of force and its effectiveness, the political  use of military displays, the impact of the possession of military power on the part  of one actor on the behavior of the other.

[翻譯]
了解人類及其行為的非理性因素的重要性，進而對於分析在70年代開始被稱為「知覺」的興趣產生了影響；也就是說，知覺與現實之間的差異。這對於了解政治使用武力及其效果、政治使用軍事示威、一方擁有軍事力量對另一方行為的影響具有至關重要的意義。

--- 段落 72 (452 字元) ---
I got into this work on perceptions, particularly this ethology aspect of it, because  when Jim Schlesinger and I were at RAND—he had arrived in the early ‘60s and I  had returned after living in Paris for a couple of years [1963–65]—one of the topics that came up between us was the work of Robert Ardrey.15 Ardrey developed  this notion of the “territorial imperative,” this very visceral response to certain kinds  of encroachments that people have.

[翻譯]
我開始對感知這項工作（尤其是行為生態學方面）感興趣，是因為當我和吉姆·施萊辛格（Jim Schlesinger）在蘭德公司工作時，他在60年代初到達，而我則是在巴黎生活了幾年後回來（1963-65）。我們之間談及的一個話題是羅伯特·阿德利（Robert Ardrey）的研究。阿德利提出了“領域本能”這一概念，人們對某些侵犯行為作出非常本能的反應。

--- 段落 73 (485 字元) ---
And this gets later into this whole issue of how  do you think about deterrence and so on.When I worked for Henry Kissinger on  the NSC, one of the things I tried to get the intelligence community to do—which  they did assign one guy to do some work on—was to try to understand what it  was about us and our behavior that the Russians paid attention to and focused  on, presumably because they thought it was important, what gave us good  scores in their books, and what things didn’t.

[翻譯]
這進一步涉及如何思考威懾等問題。當我在國家安全委員會為亨利·基辛格工作時，我試圖讓情報界做的一件事情是試圇理解俄羅斯關注和關注我們行為的原因，可能是因為他們認為這很重要，什麼讓我們在他們的書中得到良好評分，又有什麼沒有。

--- 段落 74 (283 字元) ---
The idea behind this was that one of  the things that we could do to enhance deterrence and to make the influence of  our military capabilities the highest was to understand this.And a little progress  was made, but it was seen as novel to even raise some of those kind of questions.

[翻譯]
這背後的想法是，我們可以做的一件事來增強威懾力並使我們軍事能力的影響力最大化，就是理解這一點。雖然取得了一些進展，但即便提出這種問題也被視為新穎的。

--- 段落 75 (389 字元) ---
The fact that you want to raise them and move beyond these abstract discussions  that have characterized so much of the analysis at that point was driven by this  sense that these other people, in the first place, may be different than us.Secondly, what they pay attention to, react to, is not simply a matter of calculation,  as much of the analysis up to that time had tended to suggest.

[翻譯]
你想要養育他們並超越這些抽象的討論，這些討論在很大程度上已經成為當時分析的特徵，這是由於對於這些其他人可能不同於我們的感覺所驅使的。其次，他們所關注的，所回應的，不僅僅是一種計算的問題，就像當時大部分分析所傾向的那樣。

--- 段落 76 (383 字元) ---
If you look at the  standard deterrence theory, it has this tendency to think of states as not only  unified, but rational actors.Again, the supposed unity and rationality of states had  come up very early in this work on organizational behavior and was a bad assumption, because the behavior you were thinking about was often the behavior of an  organization, not of a single actor.

[翻譯]
如果你看的是標準威懾理論，它傾向於將國家視為統一且理性的行為者。再次提到，對國家的假定統一和理性早在組織行為的研究中就出現過，這是一種不好的假設，因為你所思考的行為通常是一個組織的行為，而不是單一行為者的行為。

--- 段落 77 (359 字元) ---
A state might be made up of several organizations, and there’s this concept of the limited rationality of those organizations.And you might think of it in terms of, say, like the Russians, wanting to know what  advice, what assessments, what evaluations the General Staff gives to the leadership.And even the leadership is not necessarily a single individual.

[翻譯]
一個國家可能由多個組織組成，這裡有一個有限理性的概念。您可能會想到這樣的情況，例如俄羅斯人想知道參謀總長向領導層提供何種建議、評估和評估。即使領導層也不一定是一個單一個人。

--- 段落 78 (466 字元) ---
This led to  a great deal of emphasis in the work in this office on the Soviet assessment, the  assessment of the Soviet General Staff, of the state of the balance, as being a very  central issue which is going to be heavily influenced by the specific character of  the analysis that they undertake, the choices of scenarios that they [make], various other kinds of assumptions, which can lead to differences in specific calculations that are part of any evaluation.

[翻譯]
這導致辦公室的工作非常強調蘇聯的評估，蘇聯參謀總部對平衡狀態的評估是一個非常中心的問題，這將受到他們進行分析、制定場景選擇和其他假設的具體特性影響，這些因素可能導致任何評估中特定計算的差異。

--- 段落 79 (323 字元) ---
And we have some evidence that there are  some very significant differences there.Some later work that John Hines has done  suggests that back in the ‘60s, their thinking about us was dominated by some  inferences they made from particular things we did and nothing about what we  said.I mean, particular choices they made.

[翻譯]
我們有一些證據表明那裡存在一些非常顯著的差異。約翰·海恩斯後來的一些工作表明，在60年代時，他們對我們的看法主要是基於他們從我們做的特定事情中得出的某些推論，並不考慮我們說過的任何事情。我的意思是，他們做出的特定選擇。

--- 段落 80 (492 字元) ---
The other thing—coming back, moving beyond this organizational level of  things—is, just at the individual level, there’s a lot of evidence that man is not a  fully rational animal.People have always understood that men have emotions and that emotions can get in the way of their thinking, but that model tends to  assume that at the center of everything there is this rational calculation, and it’s  just that these emotions cloud things or distort the functioning of this rational  machine.

[翻譯]
另一方面，回到個人層面，有很多證據表明，人類並不完全是理性的動物。人們一直明白男人也有情感，情感可能會妨礙他們的思考，但這種模式通常假設在一切事物的中心是這種理性計算，只是這些情感會使事情變得模糊或扭曲這種理性機器的運作。

--- 段落 81 (333 字元) ---
But what this ethological and evolutionary view suggests is that there  is no perfect calculator at the center of this thing, that man’s ability to be rational  is itself probably, as Kahneman would suggest, still in evolution and has built-in  short cuts, quick algorithms and so on because of the bias towards action and  behavior.

[翻譯]
但是這個行為生態和演化觀點暗示著，在這一切的中心並沒有完美的計算機，人類的理性能力本身可能還在演化之中，並內建了快速算法和快捷方法，因為存在對行動和行為的偏好。這正如卡尼曼所提出的。

--- 段落 82 (424 字元) ---
Again, the work of Kahneman and Tversky shows how easily, by framing issues and questions different ways, you get different answers to what are  logically the same question.16 Then apart from the fallibility of the central rational  mechanisms, there are simply these physiological responses, the changes in  blood chemistry, which may change the behavior and the thinking of people, that  all need to be taken into account.

[翻譯]
再次，卡尼曼和特沃斯基的研究顯示，通過以不同方式界定問題和提問方式，你將得到對於在邏輯上相同問題的不同答案。除了中央理性機制的可信度外，還有一些生理反應，例如血液化學變化，可能會改變人們的行為和思維，這些都需要考慮進去。

--- 段落 83 (333 字元) ---
Because of Schlesinger’s interest in all of these kinds of things when he became  Secretary of Defense and I moved over to the Pentagon, one of the things he  asked me to work on, in particular, was this whole matter of essentially this political-psychological impact of military capabilities, military actions, displays, posturings.

[翻譯]
由於興趣廣泛，當Schlesinger成為國防部長時，而我搬到五角大廈時，他要求我專門研究軍事能力、軍事行動、展示和姿態等事項在政治心理上的影響。

--- 段落 84 (466 字元) ---
So I undertook to do this, got some money from the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency, and much of the program was done out at RAND  under Herb Goldhamer’s direction.There was an early meeting that people came  to, including Lionel Tiger, whose work I had read.17 He and Robin Fox had just put  out this book, The Imperial Animal, which I found very good and I think still is an  excellent piece.18 So we started down this road and had some general thinking.

[翻譯]
於是我決定進行這個計畫，從國防部高級研究計畫局拿到一些資金，並且在RAND機構下由赫伯特·戈德哈默指導進行了大部分的計畫。有一次早期的會議，有許多人參加，包括我讀過作品的萊昂內爾·泰格。他和羅賓·福克斯剛出版了《帝國動物》這本書，我覺得這本書非常好，我認為至今仍然是一部優秀的作品。於是我們開始了這條路程，進行了一些基本的思考。

--- 段落 85 (496 字元) ---
We had specific studies using The Economist as a surrogate for elite views in  England and Le Monde as a surrogate for French opinion to try to look historically  and see what events, what kinds of things seemed to change and shift the assessments of the military balance between ourselves and the Soviets.Goldhamer did  that work.19  Herb began to write a book which, unfortunately, he never finished, but the first  part of it has come out as this piece, Reality and Belief in Military Affairs.

[翻譯]
我們進行了特定的研究，使用《經濟學人》作為英國精英觀點的代理，使用《世界報》作為法國觀點的代理，試圖從歷史的角度來看，什麼事件，什麼事情似乎改變了我們與蘇聯之間軍事平衡的評估。 Goldhamer做了這項工作。 Herb開始寫一本書，但不幸的是他沒有完成，但它的第一部分已經出版，作為這篇文章的一部分，即《軍事事務中的現實與信仰》。

20 After he  died, we collected together and put out in a publishable form all of his notes for the  rest of the book.21 He was a very meticulous gatherer of material and so on.A lot of  interesting insights come out of that.One of the more interesting, still further things  that came up in some of Herb’s work is, if you look at the changing cultural environment, you see a change in values.

[翻譯]
在他去世後，我們將他所有的筆記集合起來，整理成一本書可以出版的形式。他是一個非常細心的資料收集者。很多有趣的見解都是由此而來的。在赫伯的一些作品中，更有趣的事情之一是，當你看著不斷變化的文化環境時，你會看到價值觀的改變。

You see that early warfare was an opportunity  for individual men to perform heroically and to attain glory.Later, war became far  more a matter of having other goals.It wasn’t an occasion for the display of individual courage and so on, but was related to some goal of a king, a prince, a state.

[翻譯]
你可看到早期的戰爭是個展現個人英勇表現和追求榮譽的機會。後來，戰爭更多是為了達成其他目標。它已不再是展示個人勇氣等等的場合，而是與某個國王、王子或國家的目標相關。

--- 段落 88 (412 字元) ---
And one of the most striking illustrations he gives—it was taken from a poem, I  think—was a case of two opponents separated by a stream, and one of them says,  in effect, “We’ll let you cross the stream so we can have a really good fight.”22 Now,  maybe it’s too romanticized, but I think he’s right, that at an earlier time that probably was true.So it changes your sense of what war and warfare are all about.

[翻譯]
他提到的最引人注目的例子之一──我想是從一首詩中得來的──描述了兩個對手被一條溪流隔開，其中一個在某種程度上說：「我們讓你過溪，這樣我們就可以展開一場真正的激戰。」也許這太浪漫化了，但我認為他是對的，在過去這樣的情況很可能是真實存在的。因此，這改變了你對戰爭和戰爭行為的理解。

--- 段落 89 (484 字元) ---
Another thing—which, again, came up in my memory of Herb Goldhamer—is the  point that we discussed, going back to these very early days at RAND, when we were looking at this whole “criteria problem” and related things, thinking about  the kind of studies RAND was doing.Herb made this very interesting, important  point that in all of these analyses, certain behavior is assumed on the part of the  men involved and, therefore, what the performance of the systems would be and  so on.

[翻譯]
另一件事，也是我記憶中 Herb Goldhamer 的一點是，當我們回顧 RAND 非常早期的日子時，我們討論過的一個觀點，當時我們正在研究這個整個“標準問題”和相關事項，思考 RAND正在進行的研究的性質。Herb 提出了這個非常有趣、重要的觀點，即在所有這些分析中，假設涉及的人展現特定的行為，並且系統的表現等等。

--- 段落 90 (465 字元) ---
23 The point he made very early was that in real life, there would be some  cases of unusual self-sacrifice that would alter all of these calculations.He gave  as his example, if all else failed, pilots ramming enemy bombers carrying nuclear  weapons and approaching the cities they were defending.And I think that’s very  real and almost all the analysis just does not capture that.It’s hard to know how  important that really is, but it needs to be thought about.

[翻譯]
他早早指出的一個觀點是，現實生活中會有一些不尋常的自我犧牲案例，這些案例會改變所有的計算。他舉例說，如果其它方法都失敗了，飛行員可以撞毀攜帶核武器並接近他們所防衛的城市的敵機轟炸機。我認為這是非常現實的，幾乎所有的分析都無法捕捉到這一點。很難知道這究竟有多重要，但這個問題需要被思考。

--- 段落 91 (334 字元) ---
Previously, I mentioned one of the early kind of anomalies in the analyses’ criteria  was that in the early RAND bomber studies, they assumed that you couldn’t go  above five percent attrition per sortie.I found that arbitrary and tried to understand  the source of it, which really was World War II and the D-Day planning constraint.

[翻譯]
先前，我提到分析標準中一種早期的異常情況是在早期蘭德轟炸機研究中，他們假設每次出動最多不能有超過五％的機組損失。我覺得這樣的限制是隨意的，並試圖了解其來源，其實是源自第二次世界大戰和D日計劃的限制。

--- 段落 92 (500 字元) ---
And then to try to persuade people that this was not the way you ought to look at  it, I tried, from whatever memoirs I could find, to calculate the attrition rates in the  early aircraft carrier battles, and I believe that they’re close to 50 percent, at least  at the strike sortie… It seemed to me that in the kind of situation which was then  being envisaged, where both sides had some nuclear weapons, that if it came to  that situation, the casualty rates of the bombers could be set very high.

[翻譯]
然後試圖說服人們，這不應該是您看待這個問題的方式，我試著根據我找到的一些回憶錄，計算早期的航空母艦戰鬥中的損失率，我相信至少在打擊出擊時損失率接近50％... 在當時所想像的情況下，雙方都擁有一些核武器，如果達到那種情況，轟炸機的傷亡率可能非常高。

--- 段落 93 (446 字元) ---
Still another theme—I guess number six on my list—is my particular notion of  how you try to look at the future.I’d say, first, that you really can’t predict the  future farther out.If you try to give a single forecast it’s kind of a fake, it tends to  eliminate uncertainties that can’t be eliminated.And in general uncertainty has to  be faced, managed, dealt with in some effective way and not simply made to go  away in some make-believe way.

[翻譯]
在我的清單上，另一個主題，我想是第六個，是關於我對如何看待未來的特定概念。我會說，首先，你真的無法預測更遠的未來。如果你試圖給出一個單一的預測，那有點虛假，它傾向於消除無法消除的不確定性。總的來說，不確定性必須面對、管理、以某種有效的方式處理，而不僅僅是以某種虛構方式使其消失。

--- 段落 94 (354 字元) ---
Unfortunately, much analysis proceeds on the  opposite principle.But there are some aspects of the future it’s possible to say something about.That’s, I think, particularly true of gross, long-term economic trends, things like  rates of growth of GNP, especially differential rates of growth of GNP.But again, it’s  a matter of picking the right experts.

[翻譯]
不幸的是，許多分析都是根據相反的原則進行的。但有一些關於未來的方面是可以談論的。我認為，這對於總體、長期的經濟趨勢特別如此，例如國民生產總值的增長率，尤其是國民生產總值的不同增長率。但再次強調，這取決於選擇正確的專家。

In that respect, Charlie Wolf has done some  really good things, and Bruce Scott of the Harvard Business School has been  absolutely miraculous with his kind of insights into how things were going to tum  out for Europe, say, in things he wrote as early as the early ‘70s.24 Another area  where there’s some chance of prediction that makes a difference is demography.And there may well be also some aspects of technology, not all of it.

[翻譯]
在這方面，查理·沃爾夫做了一些非常好的事情，而哈佛商學院的布魯斯·斯科特則憑藉他對歐洲未來發展的洞察力，可以說是神奇的。他在70年代初寫的東西中，已經提前看到了歐洲的未來。另一個可能影響預測的領域是人口統計學。還有一些技術方面可能也有影響，但不是全部。

--- 段落 96 (389 字元) ---
In general, there is a value in sketching out, thinking through some alternative  scenarios of the future, not as predictions, but as a way of enhancing our appreciation of the alternative directions in which things might go.But this creation  of scenarios has to be tailored to the purpose that the analysis is going to be  used for; there are no general-purpose scenarios for the future.

[翻譯]
一般來說，草擬並思考一些未來可能的替代情境是有價值的，這並非用作預測，而是用來增進我們對事物可能發展方向的認識。然而，這些情境的建立必須針對分析將被用於的目的進行調整；未來並不存在通用的情境。

--- 段落 97 (326 字元) ---
And there are  some people around who understand that and do good work of this sort: Peter  Schwartz is an interesting person; a man named Clem Sunter, a South African;  Bruce Scott; this man Pierre Wack.25 A number of them were associated with the  Royal Dutch Shell Group strategic planning activities in London for a while.

[翻譯]
周圍有一些人了解這一點，並做出這樣的好工作：彼得·施瓦茨（Peter Schwartz）是一個有趣的人；一位名為克萊姆·桑特（Clem Sunter）的南非人；布魯斯·斯科特（Bruce Scott）；這位皮埃爾·瓦克（Pierre Wack）先生。其中一些人曾經一段時間與倫敦的皇家荷蘭殼牌集團戰略規劃活動有關聯。

--- 段落 98 (470 字元) ---
The other thing I would say about looking at the future is to recommend thinking  of it in terms of the model that I discussed earlier of actors with goals and strategies, interacting with some kind of context.For that purpose, some form of path  gaming might be useful.I’ve been instrumental in trying to get that kind of gaming created and done, beginning in, I guess, the middle ‘80s or so.Alright, a seventh theme, I would say, is the value of gaming as a technique.

[翻譯]
我想要說的另一件事是，當考慮未來時，建議以我先前討論的角色、目標和策略模型來思考，這些角色在某種上下文中進行互動。為此，某種形式的路徑遊戲可能會很有用。我一直在努力嘗試創建和完成這種遊戲，我想，從80年代中期左右開始。好吧，第七個主題，我要說的是遊戲作為一種技術的價值。

--- 段落 99 (408 字元) ---
26  There was a really early RAND impetus towards gaming.It grew in a funny way  out of the focus on game theory.People soon found that there were games they  wanted to look at or think about that were just too hard mathematically to look for  solutions.So an idea arose, and I think it was suggested by a man named Merrill  Flood, who was at RAND at the time, and subsequently at the University of Michigan.

[翻譯]
有一個非常早期的RAND對遊戲的推動力。這是從對博弈論的關注中發展出來的一種有趣方式。人們很快發現，有些他們想要研究或思考的遊戲在數學上太難找到解決方案。於是一個想法浮現了，我認為這是由當時在RAND工作的一位名叫Merrill Flood提出的，後來他去了密歇根大學。

--- 段落 100 (396 字元) ---
He just made the observation that human beings are very good at playing games,  and can find effective strategies, reasonably effective strategies, and maybe the  way to handle some of these games that we can’t solve in closed solution mathematically would be to have them play and gain experience and devise strategies  and so on, and that could give us an insight into what good strategies are.

[翻譯]
他只是觀察到人類非常擅長玩遊戲，可以找到有效的策略，合理有效的策略，也許處理一些我們無法在數學上找到解決方案的遊戲的方式是讓他們進行遊戲、積累經驗、制定策略等等，這可能會讓我們洞察到什麼才是好的策略。

--- 段落 101 (487 字元) ---
So there were games that came from that, that were strictly kind of artificial,  small games that couldn’t be solved.But that soon led to other games—I’ll mention several—some of which were then applied to much more complex military  problems.Another thing that it led to was political gaming.Herb Goldhamer was  an early innovator in political, or kind of crisis, games which I think the first one  of that sort of thing was probably played at RAND somewhere in the mid-’50s  [1955–56].

[翻譯]
因此，從那裡出現了一些遊戲，這些遊戲嚴格來說是人造的，小小的遊戲，無法解決。但這很快就帶來了其他遊戲，我將提到幾個，其中一些遊戲後來應用於更複雜的軍事問題。另一件事是它引發了政治遊戲。赫伯·戈爾德哈默是政治或危機遊戲的早期創新者，我認為這類遊戲的第一個可能是在50年代中期的蘭德機構玩的。

--- 段落 102 (348 字元) ---
Herb ran that.27 And that led to much more elaborate and ambitious  games that Olaf Helmer and Norman Dalkey ran, big political kind of games,  and also led to a SAFE [Strategy and Force Evaluation] game, which was focused  around the allocation of budgets and kind of planning and programming for  forces, which was around the late ‘50s [1961–62].

[翻譯]
Herb負責那一部分。這導致了更加複雜和雄心勃勃的遊戲，由Olaf Helmer和Norman Dalkey組織，這是關於大政治類型的遊戲。這也導致了一個名為SAFE [Strategy and Force Evaluation]的遊戲，重點是預算分配和軍隊力量的規劃和編程，這發生在50年代後期[1961-1962年]。

--- 段落 103 (179 字元) ---
28  Anyway, I’ve been very interested in games from the point of view of an initial  way of getting some insight into the strategies that people might adopt in various situations.

[翻譯]
無論如何，我一直對遊戲從一個初步瞭解人們可能在各種情況下採取的策略的角度很感興趣。

--- 段落 104 (382 字元) ---
That led both to my interest in and use of some games in the  middle ‘80s to explore such things as the impact of an SDI [Strategic Defense  Initiative] system on the actual character of warfare, the results of which I think  were quite interesting in that they showed the problems of much of the standard  analysis, which then just missed, in my view, the really big impact of SDI.

[翻譯]
這讓我對於一些遊戲在80年代中期的興趣和使用，來探索諸如戰略防禦計畫對實際戰爭性質的影響等事宜。我認為這些研究結果非常有趣，因為它們顯示了許多標準分析的問題，這些分析只是錯失了我認為SDI所帶來的真正巨大影響。

--- 段落 105 (429 字元) ---
I mean  the impact apart from the things that people now talk about—the resource and  psychological impact it had on the Russians—which was that people changed  significantly the way in which the whole war was fought.It was as though its [the  SDI system] main effect was to change the character of the game that was played.So measuring just what it was going to do to the attrition rate didn’t capture what  it was really doing.

[翻譯]
除了人們現在談論的資源和心理影響之外，我指的是對俄羅斯人產生的影響，人們顯著地改變了整場戰爭的作戰方式。這彷彿是將整個戰爭的遊戲性質改變了。因此，僅僅衡量它對消耗率的影響並沒有捕捉到它實際上正在做的事情。

--- 段落 106 (499 字元) ---
It also turned out that, contrary to some of the arguments of  the time, both sides, when they had some SDI-type systems, felt the situation was  more stable, which wasn’t what people tended to say.I think the role of these games, as I say, is an initial, exploratory tool to try to  understand how changed weapons, capabilities, or something will change the  kind of operational concept, strategies that people will employ.An eighth theme or thought is that war and conflict are normal and natural.

[翻譯]
同時也有些證據顯示，與當時的一些論點相反，在雙方擁有某種SDI系統時，他們覺得情況更穩定，這並非人們經常所說的。我認為這些遊戲的角色，正如我所說的，是一種初始的探索工具，試圖理解如何改變武器、能力或其他方面將改變人們所採用的作戰概念和策略。第八個主題或想法是戰爭和衝突是正常且自然的。

--- 段落 107 (477 字元) ---
Robin  Fox had a very interesting, recent article in The National Interest [“Fatal Attraction:  War and Human Nature”].29  At one point—I don’t know how or why I said it—but Jim Roche then made a wall  poster out of it, I said, “I have a profound belief in the future of war.” Fox’s article is  particularly interesting in that he talks about how war ought to be seen like sex,  as part of life.It’s not something that’s unnatural that we’re going to get rid of any  time soon.

[翻譯]
羅賓·福克斯在最近的一篇《國家利益》文章中提出了一些非常有趣的觀點 [“致命的引力：戰爭和人類本性”]。在其中一段談及時—我不知道當時是如何或為何說出的—但吉姆·羅奇便將其製成了一幅海報，當時我說：“我對戰爭的未來深具信仰。”福克斯的文章特別有趣，因為他談到了戰爭應該被視為生活的一部分，就像性一樣。這不是我們很快就會消除的不自然之物。

A ninth theme or saying of “Chairman Marshall” is there’s only so much stupidity  one man can prevent.You live in big organizations in which a lot of not-so-great  things are happening most of the time.And only so much of that can be prevented.So you have to be very modest about what you think you can do.- Q1: What rules of thumb have you used in picking and choosing which idiocies to  combat?- Marshall: I think in the near term it’s hard to change almost anything.

[翻譯]
「馬歇爾主席」的第九個主題或格言是，一個人只能阻止那麼多愚蠢的事情。你生活在一個大組織中，大部分時間都在發生很多不太好的事情。而且只能阻止那麼多。所以你必須對你認為自己能做的事情非常謙虛。 - Q1：在挑選和選擇要對抗哪些愚蠢行為時，您使用了什麼經驗法則？ - 馬歇爾：我認為在短期內幾乎很難改變任何事情。

--- 段落 109 (312 字元) ---
I think the  things that you can change are longer term… This is really item ten, the strategy  for influence.At the tactical level, a lot of the things are obvious, like, give other people credit.If they steal your stuff—terrific!The main thing is to change the way people talk  about, think about the problems.

[翻譯]
我認為你可以改變的事情是長期的...這實際上是第十項，即影響力戰略。在戰術層面上，有很多事情是顯而易見的，比如讚揚其他人。如果他們偷走你的東西，太好了！最重要的是改變人們對問題的談論方式和思考方式。

--- 段落 110 (400 字元) ---
So my notion is that you work on long-term,  more or less permanent kinds of problems and issues, and try, through giving  people better ways to think about those problems, to persuade them that this is  the best way of looking at it, these are the kind of considerations that should be  taken into account.And in changed minds and shaping the way in which they  look at problems, you gain influence.

[翻譯]
所以我的觀點是，你應該致力於長期、更或多或少是永久性的問題和議題，並嘗試通過給予人們更好的思考方式來說服他們，這是最佳的觀點，這些是應該考慮的因素。當改變了人們的想法和塑造了他們看待問題的方式，你就獲得了影響力。

--- 段落 111 (420 字元) ---
And for a lot of that, you can tell whether  you’re being successful when people adopt your terminology.One of the reasons that this works, I think, in these organizations is that there’s an  enormous amount of competition for controlling or influencing the immediate  issues.It’s the nature of this government.Now, I think in a different kind of government structure, the strategy I’m suggesting would be less fruitful.

[翻譯]
對於很多人來說，你可以透過人們採用你的術語來判斷是否成功。我認為這在這些組織中奏效的原因之一是，對於控制或影響眼前議題存在著巨大競爭。這是這個政府的本質。在一種不同類型的政府結構中，我認為我提出的策略會較少奏效。

--- 段落 112 (493 字元) ---
But in our  current government, not simply the current administration, but the whole nature  of the U.S.government is that it’s designed so that nobody can decide anything,  and a decision that seems to be won one day is reversed the next day or next  week or next month.It’s hard to make any specific decision stick.And much of this competition to determine what’s going to happen tomorrow  is, in my view, a waste of effort.Nonetheless, that’s what 90 percent of the people  are involved in.

[翻譯]
然而，在我們目前的政府中，不僅僅是目前的政府管理層，而是整個美國政府的本質，它被設計成沒有人可以做出決定，一天看似贏得的決定，可能在下一天、下一周或下一個月就被推翻。很難做出具體的決定。我認為，許多為了確定明天會發生什麼的競爭，都是在浪費精力。然而，這卻是90%的人所參與的。

--- 段落 113 (412 字元) ---
And it’s interesting that I think many of the people in the government don’t understand that.An example I would give is when Schlesinger was here.This was the time when  some Russian ships were tied up and some barges were tied up near a Somali  airfield.A runway, I think, had been lengthened, and there were some buildings  there that people thought maybe meant they’re going to start emplacing some  missiles.

[翻譯]
有趣的是，我認為許多政府人士並不明白這一點。我想舉個例子，就是施萊辛格在這裡時的情況。那時有些俄羅斯船只停泊在附近海域，有些駁船停泊在索馬里一個機場附近。據我所知，一條跑道被延長了，那裡還有些建築，人們可能認為這意味著他們可能要開始部署一些導彈。

--- 段落 114 (118 字元) ---
30 Schlesinger asked me to go out to the CIA and to ask them to provide  their analysis of exactly what was happening.

[翻譯]
30 施萊辛格請我前往中央情報局，要求他們提供對正在發生的情況的準確分析。

--- 段落 115 (386 字元) ---
But in addition, he wanted them to go back and look at some other cases, because the hunch was that the whole  nature of the way in which the Russians obtained access and made use of foreign  facilities was rather different than our own, and that being able to explain that  would allow one to make a better case about what we ought to do, think through  what we ought to do, and so on.

[翻譯]
但除此之外，他希望他們回去查看其他一些案例，因為直覺是俄羅斯人獲得訪問並利用外國設施的方式與我們自己的方式截然不同，這解釋一下將使人能更好地論證我們應該做什麼，深思我們應該做什麼，等等。

--- 段落 116 (430 字元) ---
Well, the people I went to talk with said, “Yes, yes, well, of course we’ll do something, but what decision is this information that we will be providing an input to?”  And I said, “Look, Schlesinger doesn’t have in mind any particular decision.He  thinks it just would be good to have this kind of analysis and insight into the way  in which the Russians go about acquiring access, making use of some of these foreign facilities.

[翻譯]
我去找人交談，他們說：“是的，當然我們會採取行動，但我們提供的這些資訊將作為何種決定的輸入呢？”我說：“施萊辛格並沒有特定的決定在心中。他只是認為進行這種分析和洞察對於了解俄羅斯人在取得進入、利用這些外國設施的方式很有幫助。”

--- 段落 117 (427 字元) ---
And by the way, don’t you understand that it isn’t as though there’s  some decision that’s going to be made next Thursday, because that’s not what  this is all about.This is an attempt to help educate the Congress and other people.And what you’re involved in influencing is a long-term, gradual, social-cultural-political process.It isn’t as though a decision is going to be made next Thursday.But people don’t understand that.

[翻譯]
順便說一下，難道你們不明白，這不是說下週四就會做出某個決定，因為這不是這件事的目的。這只是試圖幫助教育國會和其他人。你們參與的是一個長期的、漸進的、社會文化政治的過程。不是說下週四就會做出決定。但人們不明白這一點。

--- 段落 118 (451 字元) ---
They’re very captured by this notion that there  are decisions that are made.Now, there are situations where there are decisions  that get made, as in actual operational things.I mean, yes, you do send that  fighter over there, or you commit the attack on Baghdad, and so on.Right.But  most decisions aren’t like that.They’re really part of a sequence of things [indistinct].There’s this long, complex process, and that’s what you’re participating in.

[翻譯]
他們非常被這個觀念所吸引，即存在需要做出的決定。現實情況下確實有些決定是會被做出的，例如在實際操作中的事情。比如，你確實會派遣那架戰鬥機去那裡，或者對巴格達發動攻擊，等等。但是，大多數決策並非如此。它們實際上是事情序列中的一環。這是一個漫長而復雜的過程，而你參與其中。

--- 段落 119 (466 字元) ---
So there are delusions on the part of people, like those in the intelligence community, as to what they’re actually doing, what they’re contributing to, and so on.Going back to an earlier point on the deterrence thing: The important thing is to  see the deterrence issue as an empirical problem.That is, here is this set of people,  or this country that you’re trying to persuade or dissuade from doing this or that  or these kinds of acts under these circumstances.

[翻譯]
因此，一些人，例如情報機構的人員，對他們實際在做什麼、對什麼做出了貢獻等存在著幻覺。回到前面提到的威懾問題：重要的是將威懾問題視為一個實證問題。也就是說，這裡有一組人，或是這個國家，你正在試圖說服或勸阻他們在這些情況下做這樣或那樣的行為。

--- 段落 120 (422 字元) ---
Then the problem is finding out,  what is it that is distasteful, frightening, deterring to them?And that’s an empirical issue, it’s not something you sit down and think about.People just don’t look  at that.Another point is this centrality of this political-psychological role of the military,  because most of the time that’s what it’s doing.It isn’t as though you buy the military only because a war is going to happen.

[翻譯]
問題就是找出，是什麼讓他們感到噁心、害怕、阻礙？這是一個實證問題，不是可以坐下來思考的。人們只是不會去想這些。另一個重點是軍隊的政治心理角色的中心性，因為大部分時間它就是在這樣做。並不是只有在戰爭即將爆發時才需要軍隊。

--- 段落 121 (314 字元) ---
We’ve just been through a long 40  years, when the whole function of the military was to deter the other side.Now, it does it via its capabilities to fight, but the deterrence thing itself is the  result of the calculations and the reactions of this other set of people.So understanding that is absolutely central.

[翻譯]
我們剛剛度過了長達40年的時期，整個軍事機構的主要功能是嚇阻對方。現在，它通過戰鬥能力來實現這一目標，但嚇阻本身是對這組人的計算和反應的結果。因此，理解這一點是非常重要的。

--- 段落 122 (500 字元) ---
And there are people, as I say, like Herb  Goldhamer, Jim Schlesinger, Lionel Tiger, and some of these other people who  have this new model of man, that all have something to contribute…or the cultural anthropologists.And again, most analysis treats the issues of deterrence  as entirely ones of, “If there is a war, how many targets are we going to take  out?”, which maybe isn’t entirely irrelevant, but it doesn’t get you focused on the  aspects of the thing that are probably the most important.

[翻譯]
還有一些人，就像Herb Goldhamer，Jim Schlesinger，Lionel Tiger和其他一些人，他們擁有這種新的人類模式，都有一些可以貢獻的東西...或是文化人類學家。再次，大多數分析都將威懾問題視為“如果發生戰爭，我們要摧毀多少目標？”這可能並非完全無關緊要，但它並不能讓你專注於可能最重要的事物方面。

--- 段落 123 (424 字元) ---
Another addendum—it’s really a separate kind of theme, something that I’ve certainly believed all my life, at least for the time that I can remember—is the notion that poor, mediocre answers to good questions are more important, more useful  than splendid answers to poor questions.That means that getting the questions  right is very, very important.Most analysis spends far too little time on what the  real questions are.

[翻譯]
另外一個補充——這實際上是一種獨立的主題，是我一生中一直深信的東西，至少在我記得的時間裡——即對好問題的平庸、普通的回答比對差勁問題的出色回答更重要、更有用。這意味著正確提出問題非常非常重要。大多數分析往往花太少時間來確定真正的問題是什麼。

--- 段落 124 (427 字元) ---
Also, of course, most analysis tends to gravitate, to focus on the  questions the analysts can answer, not what the real questions are.There certainly  are dramatic cases of that.I think much of the whole effort on the Soviet economy  fails on that grounds, when you look at what people really focused on.Joe Loftus’s  and my experience at RAND was that the specialists on the Soviet economy failed  to provide useful analysis.

[翻譯]
此外，當然，大多數分析往往會傾向於專注於分析師能夠回答的問題，而不是真正問題是什麼。當然有一些引人注意的案例。我認為許多有關蘇聯經濟的研究都無法提供有用的分析，當你看看人們真正關注的時候。在蘭德公司，約瑟夫·洛夫特斯（Joe Loftus）和我就是這種經驗，蘇聯經濟專家未能提供有用的分析。

--- 段落 125 (444 字元) ---
We were trying to make these improved projections of  the Soviets’ military programs.We would ask these guys—who were supposed  to be the experts on the Soviet economy—the questions that we thought were  relevant.They had no answers to them, did not ever promise to give any answers  on those things, but went merrily along answering the questions that they were  focused on.- Q1: What were the types of questions you and Loftus would ask them?

[翻譯]
我們試圖製作改進的蘇聯軍事計劃預測。我們會向這些據說是對蘇聯經濟專家的人提出我們認為相關的問題。他們對這些問題毫無答案，也從來沒有承諾要回答任何問題，但卻快樂地繼續回答他們專注的問題。- Q1：你和洛夫托斯會向他們提出什麼樣的問題？

--- 段落 126 (418 字元) ---
- Marshall: We were interested in the effect of the military burden on the long-term  prospects of the economy, and what the trade-offs were that they had to make to  support this large effort, things of that sort.And we just never could get anything.Now, the other thing I would say on the “good questions” thing is that what’s also  striking is that even if you have the answers to good questions, nobody may listen.

[翻譯]
Marshall：我們對軍負擔對經濟長遠前景的影響感興趣，以及為了支持這一巨大努力而必須做出的取捨。我們始終無法得到任何答案。另一件我想說的關於 "好問題" 的事情是，即使你有對好問題的答案，也可能沒有人願意聽。

--- 段落 127 (458 字元) ---
An example, I think, of that is that because of, initially, Feshbach’s work showing that one of the things that was going to be happening to the Soviet conscription cohort was that the ethnic composition was going to be shifting and there  were going to be many, many more of the Asian ethnics, the questions arose in  my mind, “Is that a problem?Are there ethnic tensions, difficulties?Do these people really speak Russian?What are the implications of this?

[翻譯]
我認為一個例子是最初由費希巴赫（Feshbach）的研究顯示，蘇聯徵兵隊群體中即將發生的事情之一是民族構成將發生變化，將會有更多的亞洲民族，這讓我開始思考，“這會是一個問題嗎？會有種族緊張和困難嗎？這些人真的會說俄語嗎？這會有哪些影響？”。

--- 段落 128 (337 字元) ---
”  So I had some people out at RAND, headed by Enders Wimbush, start interviewing emigres who had served in the military who could give their own personal  testimony about the kind of tensions, and also how the conscription system really  worked, in the sense of, after you were conscripted, how was it decided what your  assignment was?

[翻譯]
所以我找了一些在蘭德研究所工作的人，由恩德斯·溫布許帶領，開始訪問曾在軍隊服役的移民，他們可以提供自己的個人見證，說明壓力的種類，以及徵兵制度的運作方式。也就是說，在被徵召後，如何決定你的分配任務。

--- 段落 129 (364 字元) ---
A lot of interesting stuff came out of that, including the sense  that, yes, they were going to have a lot of trouble, not only because the language  ability of these people was not good and, if anything, was tending to decline,  but, secondly, there were enormous tensions and brutality, and therefore, significant internal problems would result if they had this.

[翻譯]
這帶來了很多有趣的事情，包括他們將會遇到很多麻煩的感覺，不僅因為這些人的語言能力不佳，甚至有下降的趨勢，而且，第二，存在著巨大的緊張和殘暴，因此，如果他們擁有這些人，將會導致嚴重的內部問題。

--- 段落 130 (470 字元) ---
The RAND group also found  out, first, that these people had been almost entirely, at that point, sent to the  construction battalions and forces, and to some of the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] divisions, because they might be needed to shoot Russians and were  much more likely to do that.Second, that when they were sent to regular combat  divisions, they tended to be cooks, bottlewashers, and not in the actual combat  teams, say, within the tanks and so on.

[翻譯]
RAND小組還發現，首先，這些人當時幾乎全部被派往建設營和武裝力量，以及一些內務部隊，因為可能需要他們射擊俄羅斯人，而他們更有可能這樣做。第二，當他們被派往正規作戰部隊時，他們往往是廚師、刷碗工，而不是在坦克等實際作戰團隊中。

--- 段落 131 (471 字元) ---
This was the case at that time; later that  changed.So if you had a lot more of them, they probably were going to have to  move into some of these other jobs.31  The people in the intelligence community, principally DIA, just disputed the fact  that they, the Soviets, were ever going to have any difficulties, that they were simply just going to manage and handle this and there was just going to be no  problem.- Q1: With no further explanation?They just asserted this?

[翻譯]
那時情況就是這樣；後來情況改變了。因此，如果你們的人口增加，他們可能會不得不轉移到其他一些工作。情報界的人，主要是國防情報局，就是否認蘇聯人會遇到任何困難的事實，他們只是認為會應對和處理這個問題並沒有問題。-問題1：沒有進一步的解釋？他們只是斷言這樣嗎？

--- 段落 132 (220 字元) ---
- Marshall: No, just by assertion.That’s the end of my themes.Maybe you can think of others later.- Q1: Those are very good.I just made a checklist for myself and I think that everything that I got here has been covered.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：不是只是主張而已。這就是我的主題結束的地方。也許你以後可以想到其他的。- Q1：這些都很好。我剛剛為自己製作了一份檢查列表，我認為這裡列出的所有內容都已經包括在內了。

--- 段落 133 (499 字元) ---
Oh, I know… In reading some of the materials yesterday, there was a series of correspondence that you had with former  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about “centers of excellence” and you kept  returning to this need for these “centers of excellence” to bring up younger analysts, training them.And that’s something that you addressed in On Not Confusing  Ourselves.32  
- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q1: We’ve talked about what makes for good analysis, but how about what makes  for good analysts?

[翻譯]
噢，我知道...昨天閱讀了一些資料，其中有一系列你與前國防部長唐納德·倫斯菲爾德關於「卓越中心」的通信，你一再強調這些「卓越中心」的必要性，以培養年輕分析師。這是你在《不要使自己困惑》中提及的事情。馬歇爾：是的，對的。問：我們已經討論過什麼是好的分析，那什麼才是好的分析師呢？

--- 段落 134 (558 字元) ---
- Marshall: I think, and it’s reflected in that chapter [“Strategy as a Profession for  Future Generations”] that what makes for good analysts, apart from their being  bright and so on, is probably early exposure to some broad set of issues, some  broad questions in some kind of group activity, where real answers are required,  where they can work as a kind of team member, without a lot of hierarchy, where  it’s not a matter of, you know, the senior professor that does all the talking and  comments from the younger people are not appreciated and so on.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾說：我認為，這在那一章節中有所反映（“將策略作為未來一代的職業”），除了他們聰明等方面，成為優秀分析師的關鍵可能是早期接觸某些廣泛議題，參與某種群體活動，在這裡需要真正的答案，能夠作為一種團隊成員工作的地方，沒有太多的等級制度，不是由資深教授說話，而年輕人的評論卻不受重視等。

--- 段落 135 (470 字元) ---
So I think  that.Now, I do worry that there are some professional backgrounds which may  kind of inoculate you against ever having the right kind of broad look at things.So it seems to me that the way it can mainly happen is through some early work  experiences.And I don’t know that there are lots of good places to have that happen right now.I may be wrong.- Q1: You think there have been more opportunities for that in the past?- Marshall: Well, there have been some.

[翻譯]
所以我認為...現在，我擔心有些專業背景可能會使你免疫於從正確的廣泛視角看待事物。所以在我看來，唯一可能發生的方式是通過一些早期的工作經驗。我不知道現在有很多好地方可以讓這種情況發生。可能我錯了。- 問題1：你認為過去機會更多嗎？- 馬歇爾：嗯，有一些。

--- 段落 136 (430 字元) ---
The RAND environment, I think, was certainly  like that.And I’ve tried to run this place in that way.And I suppose that Herman  Kahn’s place [Hudson Institute] was probably a good place for that.But I don’t  think there are lots of good places.I might be wrong about that.- Q1: One of the major themes you had in the original, extended outline was the  evolution and outcome of the Cold War, how it turned out the way that it did.

[翻譯]
我認為RAND環境肯定是這樣的。我嘗試以這種方式運營這個地方。我想赫爾曼·卡恩的地方[哈德遜研究所]可能是一個很好的地方。但我不認為有很多好地方。我可能對此有誤解。-Q1：在原始的擴展大綱中，您有一個主要主題是冷戰的演變和結果，它是如何形成今天這個樣子的。

--- 段落 137 (439 字元) ---
Obviously what you’ve been talking about today touches on all of that…  
- Marshall: No, what I was trying to do here was to discuss the kind of perspectives,  issues, attitudes that I think come up repeatedly and sort of characterize things.- Q1: That’s in a different category.- Marshall: I think so.- Q1: And then a lot of the examples that you gave bear on this issue of the interaction of analysis with the real world.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
顯然，您今天談論的內容涉及到所有這些...  
- 馬歇爾：不，我在這裡試圖討論我認為反覆出現並標誌事物的觀點、問題和態度。- Q1：那屬於不同的類別。- 馬歇爾：我想是的。- Q1：而且您給出的許多例子都涉及分析與現實世界的互動問題。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 138 (497 字元) ---
- Q1: But in particular, the theme of your strategy for influence, I think, deals with  that.- Marshall: Yes.- Q1: Would you mind if I made copies of your notes?- Marshall: No, if you want to.And then there’s this thing [Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., “The  Future Outwits Us Again,” Wall Street Journal, 20 Sep 93].I clipped this out because  it seemed to me—I usually don’t agree with him—but he had some things that  go with this theme of what you can predict about the future or how to look at…  OK.

[翻譯]
Q1: 但特別是，我認為你的影響力策略的主題是在處理這個問題。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q1：如果我複製你的筆記，你介意嗎？- 馬歇爾：不介意，如果你想的話。然後有這個事情[亞瑟·舒萊辛格（Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.），“未來再次出人意料”，《華爾街日報》，1993年9月20日]。我剪下這篇文章，因為我覺得--通常我不同意他--但他說了一些與未來預測或如何看待......OK.

--- 段落 139 (294 字元) ---
Perhaps one final thing which I think about, and one of the most important  things I think I learned when I was at RAND early on is that the objective in any  analysis is to do the best that this country can do, not just the best that RAND or  whatever organization you’re talking about can do.

[翻譯]
也許最後一件我想到的事情，也是我在 RAND 早期學到的最重要的一點是，任何分析的目的都應該是做到本國可以做到的最好，而不僅僅是做到 RAND 或任何其他機構可以做到的最好。

--- 段落 140 (449 字元) ---
One of the very good things  about RAND in the early days was that there were these problems, but a lot of  people from the outside were drawn in, both in the special summertime period  when people from universities and others came out, but also there were a lot  of visitors throughout the year.There was always a constant stream of people  like John von Neumann, and this one and that one, or this and that mathematician or physicist or economist.

[翻譯]
在 RAND 的早期，一個非常好的事情是，雖然存在問題，但很多來自外部的人被吸引進來，無論是在特殊的夏季期間，吸引來自大學和其他地方的人，也有很多訪客全年到訪。有像約翰·馮·諾伊曼這樣的人總是穿流不息，還有其他數學家、物理學家或經濟學家。

--- 段落 141 (474 字元) ---
Since we were focused, at least in the Economics  Department, on how you would bomb the Soviet economy, what was the most  effective use of the limited number of nuclear weapons, people who had been  involved in that kind of activity in World War II, like Sidney Alexander and Carl  Kaysen and others, were brought out.So there was just this whole attitude that, alright, here is the problem, what is the  best answer?What is the best solution?How should you think about it?

[翻譯]
由於經濟系部分，我們專注於如何轟炸蘇聯經濟，有限數量的核武器應如何最有效使用，參與過二戰此類活動的人，如西德尼·亞歷山大和卡爾·凱森等人，被提出來。所以整個態度就是，好吧，這是問題，什麼是最佳答案？最佳解決方案是什麼？應該如何思考這個問題？

--- 段落 142 (416 字元) ---
You see other organizations where they just don’t do that.They’d die rather than  bring in anybody else.If they’re given a problem, it’s, “What can we do?” So this  attitude is very important—and little practiced, in my view.And some of the government organizations are very bad on this or have changed.For example, when  I first knew the CIA, it was a very open place; it looked for outside help, ideas, and  so on.

[翻譯]
您會看到其他組織，他們根本不會這樣做。他們寧可死也不會拉其他人進來。如果他們面臨問題，他們會問自己該怎麼辦？所以在我看來，這種態度非常重要，但很少見到有人實踐。一些政府機構在這方面做得非常糟糕或已經改變。例如，當我第一次認識中央情報局（CIA）時，它是一個非常開放的地方；它尋求外部幫助、想法等。

--- 段落 143 (456 字元) ---
Unfortunately, by the late, maybe it’s the middle ‘60s, it had decided that it  didn’t need any help.- Q1: What precipitated that?- Marshall: I don’t know.Some of it may have been precipitated by the fact that,  in the beginning, of course, the organization itself had been brought in, newly  formed, people still had lots of external contacts, and later it had become much  more to be dominated by people whose whole careers had been in CIA.I don’t  know.

[翻譯]
不幸的是，也許是到了60年代中期，組織決定不再需要幫助。問題1：是什麼促使這種情況發生？馬紹爾：我不知道。這可能有一部分是因為，在開始時，組織本身是新成立的，人們仍然與外部建立了許多聯繫，後來它變得更多地由整個職業生涯都在CIA的人主導。我不知道。

--- 段落 144 (488 字元) ---
Now, also, of course, that was a time of some estrangement from the  universities because of the Vietnam War.But I think it was related to this kind of  maturing of the organization.- Q1: Yeah, maybe you could talk a little about that, because that’s something that  comes up in your writings, it’s part of a cycle.- Marshall: I think that that’s true.I think it’s happened to RAND, too.I don’t have a lot  to say about it, but I think that it’s very real and deserves some serious study.

[翻譯]
現在，當然，那時因為越戰的緣故，我對大學有些疏遠。但我認為這與組織的成熟有關。Q1：是的，也許你可以稍微談談這個問題，因為這是你寫作中討論的一部分。Marshall：我認為這是真實的。RAND 也發生了類似的情況。我沒有太多可以說的，但我認為這是非常重要的，值得認真研究。

--- 段落 145 (385 字元) ---
And  it’s one of the reasons, for example, going back to this thing you were mentioning, my interest in forming new centers of excellence, that I would start them new.I would not say, “RAND, we want you to reform yourself.Why don’t you do these  things.” Part of the argument I had with Rumsfeld and others was, no, you can’t  just… Look at some of these places.They ought to be small.

[翻譯]
這也是我對於建立卓越中心的興趣的原因之一，比如你提到的這件事情，我會從頭開始建立新的中心。我不會說："蘭德公司，我們希望你改革自己。為什麼不做這些事情呢？" 我和拉姆斯菲爾德和其他人有過爭論的部分是，不，你不能只…看看這些地方。它們應該是小規模的。

--- 段落 146 (429 字元) ---
They ought to be  embedded in some friendly atmosphere and not have to provide all of the administrative infrastructure that goes with an organization, like health programs and  retirement plans and all of that.And [they] maybe could be embedded in a place  that has some technical expertise; it could be used for consulting or something.But I would start these organizations new, precisely because of this aging kind of  effect.

[翻譯]
他們應該被融入一個友好的環境中，不必提供與組織相關的所有行政基礎設施，比如健康計畫和退休計劃等等。也許可以融入一個具有技術專業知識的地方；可以用於諮詢或其他用途。但是我會從頭開始建立這些組織，正是因為這種老化效應。

--- 段落 147 (482 字元) ---
How and why it takes place I think is something worthy of study, but I don’t have  anything profound to offer about that.It’s very clear in the case of the CIA.It  changed its character almost entirely, I think.And also, organizations suffer traumas and they go through periods of low morale.Certainly when Schlesinger went  out there to become Director of Central Intelligence.We ought to talk about that  later.I sent him a handwritten letter.- Q1: Oh, I think you mentioned that.

[翻譯]
我認為它如何以及為何發生是值得研究的事情，但我對此並沒有什麼深刻的見解。就中央情報局而言，它的性質幾乎完全改變了，我認為是這樣。組織也會遭受創傷，並且會經歷低士氣的時期。當施萊辛格出任中央情報局局長時，這一點是非常清楚的。我們之後應該討論這一點。我給他寄了一封手寫的信。- Q1:哦，我想你提到過這件事。

--- 段落 148 (409 字元) ---
You mentioned it to me the last time we talked,  but you didn’t go into any detail.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q1: OK.- Marshall: But it was, when he went out there, already a very low morale place.Again, it’s sort of a similarity between RAND and CIA.In the beginning, people  worked long hours, they were very immersed in their work.Later, it becomes  much more routinized, and so it’s an eight-to-five thing.

[翻譯]
你上次和我提到過這件事，但你沒有提供任何細節。-馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。-問：好的。-馬歇爾：但當他去那裡的時候，已經是一個 morale 很低的地方。再者，這點與蘭德公司和中央情報局之間有相似之處。一開始，人們工作時間很長，他們非常投入工作。後來，工作變得更加常規化，變成了每天八點到五點的事情。

--- 段落 149 (424 字元) ---
And Schlesinger sarcastically—sometime after he’d been out there, I think reflecting on some of the  things I’d told him in the letter—said, “I don’t know why they put lights in this  place.You could be trampled on the stairways at 4:30, because everybody’s bailing out.” Organizations go through that.- Q1: But you don’t know of any work that’s been done about this problem in  organizations…  
- Marshall: No, I don’t… No.

[翻譯]
謝利辛格有一次諷刺地說道，大約在他出來之後，我想反思了我在信中告訴他的一些事情，他說：「我不知道他們為什麼在這個地方裝了燈。在凌晨4:30，因為每個人都鬆了手，你在樓梯上可能會被踩死。組織也會經歷這種情況。」問題在組織中是否有探討過這個問題的研究......馬歇爾：不，我沒有...... 沒有。

--- 段落 150 (203 字元) ---
Maybe we’d have to call up some really good people in  the organizational theory, behavior area, somebody like Jim March or others, and  say, “What do people know about this?” But I think it’s very real.

[翻譯]
也許我們需要聯繫組織理論、行為領域的一些非常優秀的人，像是吉姆·馬奇或其他人，然後問他們，“人們對此了解多少?”但我認為這是非常真實的。

### Themes 2

[翻譯]
主題2

--- 段落 161 (461 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, the idea of this meeting is in some ways a recapitulation of something we did earlier, although while we covered some of it earlier I kind of did it  independently and then looked back to see a little bit about how much overlap  there was, and happily there was a fair amount, so there was some level of consistency.But the idea was to try to summarize what you might think of as “intellectual themes” over the years.So let me go through this.

[翻譯]
Marshall：嗯，這次會議的想法在某種程度上是之前我們做過的事情的一次重述，雖然我之前某些方面是獨立進行的，然後回過頭來看看有多少重疊，而幸運的是有相當多，所以有一定程度的一致性。但這個想法是試圖總結這些年來你可能會想到的“智力主題”。所以讓我來講一下這些。

--- 段落 162 (311 字元) ---
Now you’re, of course, free  to interrupt at any time, but then you will have maybe other things to add or say,  “No, no, no.I see you as very different,” or something like that.So, I would say the following; it’s my notion of things that have been major distinctive themes in the way I’ve thought about things.

[翻譯]
現在當然，您可以隨時打斷我，但之後您可能會有其他事情要補充或說，“不，我覺得你很不同”，或類似的話。所以，我想說一下以下內容；這是我對我所思考的事物中的主要獨特主題的看法。

--- 段落 163 (429 字元) ---
The first one of these is this  importance of essentially looking longer term, anyway, taking a fairly long-term  perspective, both in terms of various kinds of assessments, or this long-term competition notion.I guess certainly this notion of competitions is very central, and  certainly at the beginning, early days at RAND there was this notion of looking at  ourselves and the Soviets as being in a very extended competition.

[翻譯]
這其中第一個重要的是基本上看待更長遠，以較長期的觀點來看待各種評估，或這個長期競爭的概念。我想競爭的概念確實是非常核心的，當然在 RAND 的早期，我們將自己和蘇聯視為處於非常長期的競爭中。

--- 段落 164 (196 字元) ---
That wasn’t  very distinctive, because I think in the early ‘50s, Eisenhower and various people  had much of this.So it wasn’t as though there was something very distinctive  and special about it.

[翻譯]
這不是很特別，因為我認為在五○年代初期，艾森豪和許多人都有這方面的東西。所以，這並沒有什麼特別和獨特的地方。

--- 段落 165 (498 字元) ---
But, that if you’re going to look at that kind of thing, it’s very  important to consider social-cultural aspects of the competitors; organizational  arrangements and the degree things have derived from historical experiences,  historical arrangements within that particular society; economic growth rates  over the long-term are very important and are something to look at; demography.Because all of those things lead to comparative strengths, weaknesses that determine one society versus another.

[翻譯]
但是，如果你要研究這種事情，考慮到參賽者的社會文化背景非常重要；組織安排和事物從歷史經驗中得出的程度；長期經濟增長率是非常重要的，也值得關注；人口統計。因為所有這些因素導致了比較優勢、弱點，進而決定一個社會相對於另一個社會。

And, as I’ve already mentioned, there was this early RAND thinking that was along  this line.It unfortunately vanished in the middle ‘50s, or the second half of the  ‘50s.

[翻譯]
而且，正如我已經提到的，有這種早期的蘭德(美國蘭德公司)思維沿著這條路線。不幸的是，在50年代中期或後半期，這種思維不幸消失了。

--- 段落 167 (448 字元) ---
Then, for reasons I’ve discussed elsewhere, it recurred in my own thinking in  the period ‘68, ‘69, and led to this formulation of this notion of the long-term competition and the need for a strategy to succeed in these extended competitions,  which got transmuted later into competitive strategies, and certainly affected  my notions of the Soviet Union endgame, as it evolved, particularly the impact of  economic, demographic, and other factors.

[翻譯]
然後，由於我在其他地方討論過的原因，這個想法在我自己的思考中再次出現在 68年、69年的時期，並導致了我對長期競爭和成功制定策略以應對這些延長競爭的概念的形成，後來演變成競爭策略，當然也影響了我對蘇聯終局的看法，尤其是經濟、人口統計和其他因素的影響。

--- 段落 168 (453 字元) ---
So, anyway, the first item on my listing  of themes for myself was this importance of the long-term, the importance of  looking at extended competitions as the context and all that went with it.OK, the second thing on my…  
- Q2: Before you leave that, though, I think apropos of your remark that there was  really nothing unique about that in the early ‘50s, because the Eisenhower  Administration was looking…  
- Marshall: Well, or generally at RAND.

[翻譯]
所以，無論如何，我列出給自己的主題清單中的第一個是長期的重要性，重要的是要將延長的競爭作為背景以及所有相關的事情。好的，接下來的事情是...
- Q2: 在你離開之前，我認為你所說的這一點與五十年代初期沒有什麼特別之處，因為艾森豪政府正著眼於...
- Marshall: 嗯，或者一般來說在RAND。

--- 段落 169 (473 字元) ---
There were a number of people…  
- Q2: Yeah, at RAND.That may be so, but I think one of your major contributions is  that you kept with that.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: It was almost like a strategic fad for everybody else.They were like, “OK, what’s  the strategy du jour,” or “Oh, my gosh, that doesn’t work, let’s do MAD [Eds: mutual  assured destruction], or let’s do massive retaliation,” or, other constructs.But, you  held, and have held, constant to that view for years.

[翻譯]
有許多人... -Q2:是的，在蘭德公司。也許是這樣，但我認為你的一項主要貢獻是，你一直堅持著這一點。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：對其他人來說，這幾乎就像是一種戰略流行趨勢。他們會說，“好吧，今天的策略是什麼？”或者“天啊，那不行，讓我們採取相互確保毀滅的政策，或者進行大規模報復”，或者其他構想。但你多年來一直堅持著這個觀點，也持續不變。

--- 段落 170 (284 字元) ---
We’ve come back to that as  a nation from time to time, like with competitive strategies, and you’ve been this  kind of constant reminder that if you’re going to really think seriously about strategic relations with other countries and things that you need to hold this kind of  view.

[翻譯]
我們作為一個國家不時回到這一點，就像競爭策略一樣，你一直是這種持續提醒，如果你真的要認真思考與其他國家的戰略關係以及需要抱持這種觀點。

--- 段落 171 (401 字元) ---
- Marshall: Right, although even in my own life there was certainly this emphasis on  it through the ‘50s, maybe a little longer than other people, and then this recurrence in the late ‘60s, of going back to it as very important.OK, a second thing is in some ways related.It’s really just this importance of  resources; that the economics of the situation really matters, especially in the longer run.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：沒錯，盡管在我的生活中，50年代肯定是強調這一點的，也許比其他人更長一點，然後在60年代後期再次回歸，重視它的重要性。好的，第二件事在某種程度上與此有關。這就是資源的重要性；情況的經濟因素真的很重要，尤其是在長遠的情況下。

--- 段落 172 (117 字元) ---
I raise that because it’s been my sense that there aren’t very many people  who actually seem to really believe that.

[翻譯]
我提出這個問題是因為我覺得其實並沒有很多人真的相信這一點。

--- 段落 173 (387 字元) ---
I know in the discussions here I’ve mentioned before that in my conversations with military officers that came up, particularly in connection with the competitive strategies notions as they developed in  the late ‘70s, early ‘80s, there was a tendency on the part of these officers to see  the Russians as never having any resource constraints, that they could just add  on indefinitely.

[翻譯]
我知道在這裡的討論中，我先前曾提到過，在我與軍官交談時談到，尤其是與在70年代末、80年代初發展的競爭策略概念相關時，這些軍官傾向於認為俄羅斯從來沒有任何資源限制，他們可以無限制地增加。

--- 段落 174 (273 字元) ---
So the notion of cost-imposing strategies as having much payoff  was, I think, something very hard for other people to buy.And it has a lot of ramifications, because every society has cost or resource constraints, and the military  establishments have resource constraints.

[翻譯]
因此，我認為許多人很難接受以代價較高的策略為基礎，並且具有高回報的概念。這有許多後果，因為每個社會都有成本或資源限制，軍事機構也有資源限制。

--- 段落 175 (438 字元) ---
Then it also, of course, led to, again, as part of this long-term perspective on the  Soviet Union, my interest in Murray Feshbach’s work, first on the demography  and the shifting ethnic balance of the conscript cohort of the Soviet Union, which  meant there were going to be fewer and fewer Russians, and people speaking  reasonably good Russian, and people with needed skill levels, and so on, and all  the things went along with that.

[翻譯]
這當然也導致了我對蘇聯的長期觀點的興趣，其中包括對默里·費什巴赫（Murray Feshbach）在蘇聯兵役群體的人口統計和種族平衡變化方面的研究。這意味著將會有越來越少的俄羅斯人、說俄語流利的人和具備所需技能水平的人，以及隨之而來的種種問題。

--- 段落 176 (369 字元) ---
And it also led me to get him interested in and push him into this look at the  Soviet health care system, and pollution, and the environmental problems,  because it seemed to me in the longer term that no society could really ignore  the implications or the consequences of the neglect in those areas, because in the  end it leads to a weaker, less-typical population.

[翻譯]
這也讓我開始引起他對蘇聯的醫療系統、污染和環境問題的興趣，並推動他進行研究，因為我認為從長遠來看，任何社會都不能忽視在這些領域忽略的後果或影響，因為最終將導致人口更虛弱、更不典型。

--- 段落 177 (470 字元) ---
I even used the crack of, “A farmer  may not care whether his cows are happy unless it’s related to the output of the  milk,” and even a totally ruthless nomenklatura in the end has to worry about the  productivity and capacity of the population below.Then there’s the fix-up costs that then become competitive to other allocations  and resources to the military, and that that would be an important thing to  develop, not so much from a humanitarian or “Isn’t it awful?

[翻譯]
我甚至使用了「農夫可能不關心他的奶牛是否快樂，除非這與牛奶的產量有關」這個破解的資料，而即使在最後一刻，一個完全無情的特權階級也必須擔心下層人口的生產力和能力。然後還有維修成本，這些成本變得與其他分配和資源對軍事競爭力，這將是一個重要的發展，並不是出於人道主義或「這不是很糟糕嗎？」。

--- 段落 178 (494 字元) ---
” point of view, but  from a kind of strategic point of view and perspective.Indeed, that it would be  good to try to publicize what was happening to the health and the life expectancy of the Soviet population, to heat up the demand for doing something about these things, as a drain from the resources available for the military.Now,  nothing ever much happened about that.It proved impossible to get the U.S.propaganda people, even in the Reagan Administration, to take such things seriously.

[翻譯]
從一種戰略觀點和角度來看，確實值得嘗試宣傳蘇聯人口健康和預期壽命的情況，加熱對解決這些問題的需求，因為這會消耗可用於軍事的資源。然而，這方面並沒有取得太大進展。事實證明，即使在里根政府，也無法讓美國的宣傳人員認真對待這樣的事情。

--- 段落 179 (478 字元) ---
- Q2: Did you ever think that the declining health care and adverse demographics  might not only affect the Soviet capabilities in terms of degrading them, essentially, but also might affect their interests in terms of creating internally generated  strategic imperatives to take other courses of action?I mean, not just creating  lebensraum, but actually, “OK, we’ve got a lousy health care system over here, let’s  go see if we can acquire one in a hostile takeover somewhere?

[翻譯]
Q2: 你有沒有想過，衰退的醫療保健和不良的人口結構，可能不僅會影響蘇聯在降級能力方面的表現，而且還可能影響他們在創造內部生成的戰略要務方面，以採取其他行動？我的意思是，不僅僅是創建生存空間，而實際上是“好吧，我們這裡有一個糟糕的醫療保健系統，讓我們去看看是否可以透過敵對併購的方式獲得另一個？”

--- 段落 180 (188 字元) ---
”  
- Marshall: No, I didn’t think it would likely lead to that.I did think that it might lead  to dislike, distrust of the elite and that might have some longer term kind of consequences.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：不，我並不認為這可能會導致那種情況。我只是認為這可能會導致對菁英的厭惡、不信任，這可能會帶來一些長期影響。

--- 段落 181 (446 字元) ---
And there were people, for example, particularly there was this whole  school of writers—I think they were called the “Siberian school” of writers—who  were Russian and, in some sense, very nationalistic at one level, but at another  level were very concerned, increasingly concerned about the environment and  what was happening in Siberia.And hence, this might eventually lead to some  pressure to turn inwards and spend monies on these things.

[翻譯]
有些人，例如，特別是有這樣一整個作家學派 - 我認為他們被稱為“西伯利亞學派”的作家 - 他們是俄羅斯人，在某種程度上非常民族主義，但在另一個層面上非常關注環境和西伯利亞所發生的事情。因此，這可能最終會導致一些壓力，使人們轉向內部，並在這些事情上花費資金。

--- 段落 182 (466 字元) ---
OK, the second theme that struck me in thinking about it is this one of “knowing the opponent is important.” That means not treating the opponent as some  abstract, rational calculator that we don’t have any data about, but which you  speculate what some clever other fellow would do.I always say, “I don’t know why  I felt all this,” and in some of this I don’t know the answer to, “Why was I interested  in these things?” I guess some of it’s just reading history.

[翻譯]
好的，思考後讓我印象深刻的第二個主題是「了解對手的重要性」。這意味著不將對手視為我們沒有任何數據的抽象、理性計算機，而是猜測聰明的其他人會做些什麼。我總是說，“我不知道為什麼我感覺到這些”，有些事情我不知道答案，“我為什麼對這些事情感興趣？”我想其中一部分就是閱讀歷史。

--- 段落 183 (273 字元) ---
I think you can’t come  away believing in rational opponents and actors if you read any of that.And so, I remember early on being very dissatisfied with some of the game-theory enthusiasts at RAND and the limited, in my mind, usefulness and relevance  of minimax solutions.

[翻譯]
我認為如果你讀過這些內容，就不可能對理性的對手和行為者產生信心。因此，我記得很早就對蘭德公司的一些博弈理論愛好者感到不滿，並認為極小化解決方案的用途及相關性有限。

--- 段落 184 (451 字元) ---
It seemed to me that you always either knew something  about the opponent and how he might behave, or you could find some information about it that would be very useful, and so settling for this absolute assured  kind of outcome, independent of knowledge about the opponent and his preferences, was not really very interesting.Certainly you don’t want to assume rationality.You need to focus on the actual  facts about the world and how people behave.

[翻譯]
我覺得你要麼對對手的情況和他可能的行為有所了解，要麼可以找到一些對你非常有用的信息，所以為了結果而接受絕對保證，而不在乎對手及其偏好的知識，就不是很有趣。當然，你不應該假設對手是理性的。你需要關注世界上的實際事實以及人們的行為。

--- 段落 185 (463 字元) ---
Also, it seemed to me—again, in  this game-theory context—that exploiting weaknesses and irrationalities were  part of the game, and that game theory, as structured, tended to drive you away  from that.And then for some reason, I’ve always had this long-term interest in other kinds  of models of behavior, other than this rational model.Where’d that come from?I  don’t know.Well, one source was certainly an interest in history.The history wasn’t that  detailed.

[翻譯]
此外，在這個博弈理論的背景下，似乎利用弱點和不合理行為是遊戲的一部分，而結構完整的博弈理論卻傾向於讓你遠離這點。然後，出於某種原因，我一直對行為的其他類型模型有著長期的興趣，而不僅僅是這個理性模型。這是從哪裡來的呢？我不知道。嗯，其中一個來源肯定是對歷史的興趣。這種興趣不是那麼詳細。

--- 段落 186 (325 字元) ---
I mean, reading Arnold Toynbee, I think, had a big impact on me.But  clearly just observing the world you see that the behavior of states and some  individuals’ emotions, honor, pride, are not captured very well in this sort of other  thing.Then, fairly early on I got very interested in bureaucracy, organizational behavior.

[翻譯]
我是說，閱讀阿諾德·湯因比的著作對我有著很大的影響。但很明顯地，僅僅觀察世界，你會發現國家的行為和一些個人的情感、榮譽、自尊，在這種其他事物中無法被很好地捕捉到。然後，很早以前我就對官僚制度、組織行為非常感興趣。

--- 段落 187 (476 字元) ---
This interest developed in the late ‘50s and was driven, as I’ve mentioned before,  by dealing with the puzzles of the Soviet military, and the kind of behavior that  you saw in terms of the kinds of systems and programs the Soviet military had.I remember working with Joseph Loftus and saying, “Well, what is it that we’re  trying to predict the behavior of?It’s big organizations.And what do we know  about that?” Then you go off and try to find what people know about that.

[翻譯]
這種興趣在50年代後期發展起來，正如我之前提到的，是通過處理蘇聯軍隊的謎題以及所見到的蘇聯軍隊在系統和計劃方面的行為驅動的。我記得和約瑟夫·洛夫特斯一起工作時說過：“我們試圖預測的是什麼行為？是大型組織。我們對這方面了解多少？”然後你會去尋找人們對這方面了解多少。

--- 段落 188 (443 字元) ---
And  there already were some things that were being done.Fairly soon you get on the  track of Jim March and other people at Carnegie-Mellon University and they have  interesting ideas about organizations and how they behave and [their] limited  rationality…  Then in the ‘60s, I discovered ethology, initially through reading Robert Ardrey.Jim Schlesinger was at RAND then and he had read Ardrey and we spent a lot of  time talking about that.

[翻譯]
有一些事情已經開始進行。很快，你會接觸到卡內基梅隆大學的吉姆·馬奇和其他人，他們對組織以及它們的行為和有限的理性有著有趣的想法...然後在60年代，我通過閱讀羅伯特·阿德里最初接觸到行為學。當時吉姆·施萊辛格在蘭德公司，他也讀過阿德里的書，我們花了很多時間討論這個話題。

--- 段落 189 (352 字元) ---
Then I discovered our friend Lionel Tiger, who had written  a book on Men in Groups in the late ‘60s.And when Schlesinger became Secretary  of Defense I even undertook to start corresponding with Ardrey and we had a  meeting with Schlesinger and Ardrey and me on one of his visits here.He was living in Rome, I guess, and then he moved to South Africa.

[翻譯]
然後我發現了我們的朋友萊昂內爾·泰格（Lionel Tiger），他在60年代末寫了一本關於男人群體的書。當施萊辛格（Schlesinger）成為國防部長時，我甚至開始與阿德里（Ardrey）通信，我們在他來訪時和施萊辛格、阿德里和我開了個會面。他當時住在羅馬，後來搬到了南非。

--- 段落 190 (358 字元) ---
And then, somewhere along the line, I discovered Daniel Kahneman and Amos  Tversky, and how we’re probably hardwired to make certain kinds of mistakes.And then, for some reason, even much earlier I had been very interested in  Darwinian notions of evolution and read books by this fellow Rene Dubos and  another book by a man named C.H.Waddington about that.

[翻譯]
在某個時刻，我發現了丹尼爾·卡尼曼和阿莫斯·特沃斯基，以及我們可能是天生會犯一些錯誤的。而更早之前，由於某些原因，我對達爾文的進化觀念非常感興趣，閱讀了這位名叫雷恩·杜博斯的書以及另一本由C.H.華丁頓所著的關於進化的書籍。

--- 段落 191 (449 字元) ---
34  So this whole notion that Ardrey and…that goes back into the ‘40s… that Ardrey  and Tiger and these people were putting forth…or for that matter, when you talk  personally with Kahneman and Tversky and you ask them why these things are  the way they are, they go back to the way the brain actually functions and so on.So it was just very natural for me to see human beings as the product of evolution  and of having certain patterns of behavior.

[翻譯]
所以這個整體概念是，阿德里和……這可以追溯到40年代……阿德里和老虎等人提出的……或者當你與卡尼曼和特維斯基私下交談時，你問他們為什麼事情會變成這樣時，他們回溯到大腦實際運作的方式等等。所以，對我來說，很自然地看到人類是進化和擁有某些行為模式的產物。

--- 段落 192 (493 字元) ---
I also had an awareness—I don’t know quite where it came from—of the need  to be willing to accept that the belief structures of others might be very different  from your own.That’s certainly true when you start looking at different cultures.I think I’ve mentioned to some of you—I’ve never checked its claims independently so I don’t know—but one of the most striking recent articles was this  article about Columbus and his supposed motivations.I mean this… Schama…  
- Q3: Oh, Simon Schama.

[翻譯]
我也有一種意識，我不確定它是從哪裡來的，就是需要願意接受別人的信仰結構可能與自己的非常不同。當你開始研究不同的文化時，這一點顯然是真實的。我想我已經向你們中的一些人提到過，我從未獨立核實過它的主張，所以我不知道，但最引人注目的最近一篇文章之一是關於哥倫布及其所謂的動機。我的意思是... 謝馬...
- Q3: 喔，西蒙·謝馬。

--- 段落 193 (246 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yeah.He wrote this very interesting article in The New Republic reviewing,  back in ‘93 [1992], a whole bunch of books about Columbus and making the point  that Columbus’s view of things is so different from anything we could imagine.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：是的。他在《新共和》雜誌中寫了一篇非常有趣的文章，回顧了九三年（一九九二年）關於哥倫布的一大堆書籍，並指出哥倫布對事物的看法與我們所能想像的完全不同。

--- 段落 194 (534 字元) ---
35  I mean his view of the world, which Schama claimed—I have no idea whether  you could prove that this was Columbus’s view—meant that, in part, Columbus’s  exploration was not just a matter of gold and this and that, but it really was about  saving souls, which most people these days could not really imagine, but then  there was a different religious climate and a sense that the world would end sometime soon and there would be the Final Judgment, and it’s imperative to get  as many people into the Christian Church as possible.

[翻譯]
35 我指的是他對世界的看法，斯查馬聲稱——我不知道你是否能證明這是哥倫布的觀點——這部分意味著，哥倫布的探險不僅僅是金子之類的事情，而是真的是關乎拯救靈魂，如今大多數人無法想像，但那時有不同的宗教氛圍和世界將會在不久後結束並且會有最終的審判的感覺，將盡可能多的人帶入基督教教會至關重要。

--- 段落 195 (372 字元) ---
Now that was a view I’ve never even heard before—I don’t even know whether  it’s true—but it seems, given my general notion that there can be surprising  differences in perspective, it’s not implausible.I mean, Schama is a respectable,  serious historian, and I think he’s reporting on one of the books about what was  Columbus’s view of the world and of life at the time.

[翻譯]
這是一個我從來沒聽過的觀點 - 我甚至不知道它是否真實 - 但考慮到我一般認為視角可能存在驚人差異，這並非不合理。我的意思是，夏瑪是一位值得尊敬的、認真的歷史學家，我認為他是在報導有關哥倫布在當時對世界和生命看法的一本書中的內容。

--- 段落 196 (449 字元) ---
A modern American person  would find it very difficult to look at things that way and therefore, unless he  knows that this person has different perspectives, he would not even imagine  anything like that.The last little note I have under this importance of knowing the opponent is that  it really means that deterrence or influencing the behavior of others is a very  empirical matter.Deterrence is not treated very well in the standard literature.

[翻譯]
一個現代的美國人會覺得很難從那種角度來看事情，因此，除非他知道這個人有不同的觀點，否則他甚至不會想像到這樣的事情。我在對手認識的重要性下有最後一個小筆記，那就是這確實意味著威懾或影響他人行為是一個非常具體的問題。在標準文獻中，威懾並沒有得到很好的對待。

--- 段落 197 (436 字元) ---
We tried to apply this theme of knowing the opponent very much in the stuff we  did on the Soviet stuff, in the targeting revision in the ‘70s [the Nuclear Targeting  Policy Review].And John Hines’s stuff shows even at the level of the professional  military in the Soviet Union these surprising differences of assumptions, going  to such basic things as how big a crater does a nuclear weapon create and all the  ramifications of that.

[翻譯]
我們嘗試將對手了解的主題應用到我們在蘇聯事務上所做的工作中，例如在上世紀70年代進行的核目標政策審查。約翰·海恩斯的研究甚至展示了在蘇聯專業軍事人員層面存在的這些令人驚訝的假設差異，包括核武器將創造多大的彈坑等基本事項以及相關影響。

--- 段落 198 (446 字元) ---
My fourth general theme was the importance of reality as the reference.Again,  this somewhat duplicates the other things.As I said earlier, if you’re trying to  understand the Soviets and speculate about them and make projections you  have to certainly try to bring to the analysis as much as you know about the  Russians and so on, and about large organizations, Russian organizations—if you  can know anything—if you’re really going to do that.

[翻譯]
我的第四個一般主題是將現實視為參考的重要性。再次地，這有點重覆之前提到的其他要素。正如我之前所說，如果你試圖了解蘇聯人並推測他們，並做出預測，你必須確實地嘗試將你對俄羅斯人的了解和對大型組織、俄羅斯組織的知識帶入分析中，如果你真的要這樣做的話。

--- 段落 199 (493 字元) ---
Sitting back and speculating  without any data about it is not very helpful.There was this very interesting RAND study, which I referred to in other talks, that  in the middle ‘50s did just that and said, “Well, where are the Russian intercontinental bomber bases?” and put them all deep in the country along the TransSiberian railroad at the time when Loftus and I knew where they were and we  were not allowed to tell the other people that.Instead, we would say to them,  “No.Where are ours?

[翻譯]
坐在那里推测，没有任何数据支撑，这并不是很有帮助。有一项非常有趣的RAND研究，我在其他讲话中提到过，它就是在50年代中期做了这样的事，并说，“俄罗斯远程轰炸机基地在哪里？” 当时他们将这些基地全部设置在沿着中西伯利亚铁路深处的国家，而我们和洛夫特知道它们的确切位置，但我们不被允许告诉其他人。相反，我们对他们说，“不，我们的基地在哪里？”

--- 段落 200 (244 字元) ---
Well, a lot of them are where they were back in the 1920s,  when the range of airplanes was pretty short and where we put them near the  coast, near our borders because we were supposed to be defending ourselves, or  where the good weather was.

[翻譯]
嗯，很多地方在1920年代時就已經存在了，飛機的航程很短，所以我們把它們放在靠近海岸、靠近邊界的地方，因為我們應該是在保護自己，或者是天氣好的地方。

--- 段落 201 (451 字元) ---
”  Even this emergence or reemergence of this long-term competition thing really  comes from a relook backward at what had been happening up to 1969 and  you see this kind of pattern of behavior on both sides in the strategic nuclear  area, and you see that to some extent you’re engaged in an extended kind of  move-countermove sort of situation, and at looking at that and thinking what the  strategy for that would be is an interesting thing to do.

[翻譯]
即使這種長期競爭的出現或再次出現實際上源於對1969年之前發生的事情的回顧，您會看到在戰略核領域雙方都有這種行為模式，並且您會看到在某種程度上您正在參與一種長期的對抗情況，仔細研究並思考如何制定策略將是一件有趣的事情。

Also, Herman Kahn and I felt that it was possible to classify people into people  who were model-oriented and those who were reality-oriented and most of our  colleagues at RAND were model-oriented.People get dragged into that and most of academia is designed to turn people into model-oriented individuals.This is  certainly true in economics.- Q3: Models are simple.Marshall: And…  
- Q4: Would you elaborate for a second or clarify?In this case, by model I could either  mean simulations, etc.

[翻譯]
同時，赫爾曼·卡恩和我認為可以將人分為以模型為導向的人和以現實為導向的人，而我們在蘭德公司的大多數同事都是以模型為導向的。人們被拖入其中，大多數學術界都設計成將人們變成以模型為導向的個體。這在經濟學中當然是真實的。- Q3：模型是簡單的。馬歇爾：而且...
- Q4：您能再詳細說明一下或澄清一下嗎？在這種情況下，模型可以指模擬等。

--- 段落 203 (379 字元) ---
, or I could mean simple-minded assumptions about how  the world operates.- Marshall: No, it’s more general.It tends to be that people start with some sort of  notions about how the world works and then they get elaborated and people  end up being focused on the nuances of the next little elaboration of the model,  but the elaboration is not necessarily connected with reality.

[翻譯]
,或者我指的是對世界運作方式的簡單想當然。- 馬歇爾：不，它更加一般性。人們往往從一些有關世界運作方式的概念開始，然後這些概念被進一步細化，人們最終專注於模型的下一個細微進一步，但這種細化不一定與現實相連。

--- 段落 204 (419 字元) ---
Say in economics,  where people first start out assuming that all of the supply and demand functions  are continuous mathematical functions, and then they start saying, well, can we…  And then, therefore, you get to certain kinds of conclusions about how demand  matches supply and so on.Then they will start working on, What if they’re discontinuous in some minor way?And then, What if they’re even more discontinuous?

[翻譯]
在經濟學中，人們首先假設所有供求函數都是連續的數學函數，然後他們開始思考，嗯，我們可以...然後，因此，你得出一些關於需求如何匹配供應等等的結論。然後他們將開始思考，如果它們在某些微小的方式上是不連續的呢？還有，如果它們是更不連續呢？

--- 段落 205 (236 字元) ---
Can you still… [gap for tape change]  …And they become indifferent to data and what the real world is like.The  rewards go to people who can prove theorems or maintain findings under still  more and more relaxed mathematical conditions.

你還能... [更換錄音帶的間隙] ... 他們變得對數據和現實世界是什麼樣子變得冷漠。獎勵歸於那些能夠證明定理或在越來越寬鬆的數學條件下持守發現的人。

I remember Herman saying that  what was interesting to him in physics was that even people who were primarily  theoreticians, like Edward Teller… And one of the good things about physics, was  that there was another class of people who did experiments and the theorists  paid a lot of attention to the results of the experimenters.And that wasn’t true in  a lot of other fields, where there may not be a separate class of experimenters, the  equivalent of experimenters.

[翻譯]
我記得赫曼說，他對物理學感興趣的地方是，即使是主要從事理論研究的人，像愛德華·特勒（Edward Teller）一樣... 而物理學的一個優點是，還有一群人是從事實驗的，而理論家們對實驗者的結果非常重視。這在許多其他領域並不成立，那裡可能沒有一個類似實驗者的獨立群體。

Secondly, even if there were, they might be considered such low creatures that one didn’t pay any attention to anything they did.Or  they’re off in some periphery of the science and so they don’t count.Anyway, I ended there in my notes on themes, but then I had one page of kind of  “beliefs.”  
- Q2: Before you start that, as somebody who has invested millions and millions of  taxpayers’ dollars in models…  
- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
其次，即使有，它們可能被視為如此低等的生物，以至於人們不會注意它們所做的任何事情。或者它們可能在某種科學的邊緣，因此它們不被計算在內。不管怎樣，在我的主題筆記中，我就結束於此，不過我還有一頁關於一些"信念"的內容。  
- Q2：在你開始之前，身為一個投入了數百萬稅款的模型的人...  
- Marshall：是的。

--- 段落 208 (409 字元) ---
- Q2: …maybe we don’t want to leave the impression that you’re a complete skeptic  on the utility of models, and I take it that the point is that, I mean, one, you should  always keep coming back to reality to kind of validate the model…  
- Marshall: Yes, yes.- Q2: …or verify or adjust, etc.- Marshall: That’s right.- Q2: But also not to get caught up in the model for the model’s sake…  
- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
Q2: ...也許我們不想給人留下你對模型的效用完全懷疑的印象，我理解的重點是，我是說，首先，你應該總是回到現實中來驗證模型...  
- 馬歇爾：是的，是的。- Q2: ... 或者驗證或調整，等等。- Marshall：就是這樣。- Q2: 但也不要為了模型本身而陷入其中...  
- 馬歇爾：對的。

--- 段落 209 (454 字元) ---
- Q2: …but run the model as an analytic tool to help get insights or guide analysis or  something and not get caught in the beauty and the intricacy of the model for its  own sake.- Marshall: Yes, I think that’s…  
- Q2: I mean, clearly you don’t have total disdain and distaste for models.- Marshall: No, no, no, obviously not, because, again, as in the physics case where it  kind of goes along in a healthier way, there have been phenomenal successes.

[翻譯]
Q2：...但將模型運行為一種分析工具，以幫助獲取洞察或引導分析，而不是為了模型本身的美感和精妙而困擾。- 馬歇爾：是的，我認為這是…

Q2：我的意思是，顯然你並不完全厭惡和厭棄模型。- 馬歇爾：不，不，不，顯然不是，因為就像在物理學案例中一樣，它以更健康的方式發展，已經取得了驚人的成功。

--- 段落 210 (403 字元) ---
- Q5: Even in these much fuzzier areas you…when push comes to shove, you can’t  get along without models of some sort…  
- Marshall: That’s right.- Q5: …you have assumptions, you have concepts, you have ideas about how things  work…  
- Marshall: Right.- Q5: Those are.in effect, models.You may not have three million lines of computer  code or something like that, but you’re still operating on models.

[翻譯]
- Q5: 即使在這些更模糊的領域中，當勢不兩立時，你仍然無法在沒有某種模型的情況下進行。  
- 馬歇爾: 是的。- Q5: …你有假設，你有概念，你對事物運作方式有想法…  
- 馬歇爾: 是的。- Q5: 實際上，這些是模型。也許你沒有三百萬行的電腦代碼之類的東西，但你仍在運作模型之上。

--- 段落 211 (448 字元) ---
But I think the  point you correctly brought out is you got to keep going back to the empirical  realm and check it against reality.- Q4: I like particularly the part about people who were modelers had different brains  from real people.- Q2: It’s a left side, right side issue.- Q3: Two points.One, I think the distinction between modelers and non-modelers  is very important.And I understand what you two are trying to do: rehabilitate  modelers.

[翻譯]
但我認為你正確提出的要點是，你必須不斷回歸實證領域，與現實做出比對。- Q4: 我尤其喜歡有關模型者和真實人有不同大腦的部分。- Q2: 這是關於左腦和右腦的問題。- Q3: 兩點。首先，我認為模型者和非模型者之間的區別非常重要。我明白你們正在努力的目標：重建模型者的形象。

--- 段落 212 (463 字元) ---
Let me reinforce the pathological tendencies of the models.If you start  with a model, you are consciously choosing to ignore a huge aspect [indistinct].What’s the model do?Focuses attention: I know what the key variables are, I’m  going to look at those.- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: And I have to do that, the rationale is, because I can’t look at everything.Right?What does Andy do?He looks at everything.The other way to approach it is: I  don’t know what’s going on.

[翻譯]
讓我強調模型的病態傾向。如果你從一個模型開始，你是有意選擇忽略一個巨大的方面。模型做什麼？專注於：我知道關鍵變數是什麼，我將專注在這些變數上。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3：我必須這樣做的理由是，因為我無法查看所有方面對嗎？Andy做什麼？他看所有事情的方式也是：我不知道發生了什麼。

--- 段落 213 (302 字元) ---
I mean this should be the caricature of a study.You  start out without any preconceptions—and by the way, that includes all them,  because you always have preconceptions.It’s better to have those preconceptions, model their explicit [indistinct] and focus on them and then you can come  fixate on them.

[翻譯]
我是說這個應該是研究的漫畫。你開始時沒有任何先入為主的觀念 - 順便提一下，這包括全部，因為你總是有先入為主的觀念。最好擁有這些觀念，對它們進行明確定義，並專注在它們上，然後你就可以固定在它們上。

--- 段落 214 (434 字元) ---
But I think there is this ideal of having the best of both worlds,  having some rigor, in a sense [indistinct] what you’re saying, instead of having  this… But it does have this tendency to go off [indistinct] for reasons which have  probably something to do with the nature of people’s heads.But if somebody met you, kind of at the age of 25 or 30, my guess is that they  would bet you’re a modeler.- Marshall: That’s probably right.

[翻譯]
但我認為有這種理想，即兼具嚴謹性和你所說的某種意義，而不是只有這個... 但它確實會有這種偏離的傾向，原因可能與人們的思維方式有關。但如果有人在你25或30歲時遇到你，我猜他們可能會認為你是一名建模者。- 馬歇爾：這可能是對的。

--- 段落 215 (482 字元) ---
- Q3: Because you like math, you like chess, you like these abstract puzzles.And by personality you are somewhat reticent, not diving right into the maelstrom of  human activity.- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: And you would think this is a classic mathematician, an abstract thinker.- Marshall: Yes, yes.- Q3: So what happened?I mean just because you read history books?- Marshall: Look, I mean, it’s true.Early on, what did I read?Well, like every boy, I  liked all kinds of military things.

[翻譯]
Q3: 因為您喜歡數學，您喜歡下棋，您喜歡這些抽象的拼圖。而根據您的個性，您有些含蓄，不會馬上投身於人類活動的漩渦中。 - 馬歇爾：是的。 - Q3：您會認為這樣的人是典型的數學家，抽象思維者。 - 馬歇爾：是的，是的。 - Q3：那發生了什麼事？我的意思只是因為您讀了歷史書？ - 馬歇爾：看，我是說，這是真的。從早期開始，我讀了什麼？嗯，就像每個男孩一樣，我喜歡各種軍事事物。

In addition, at that period, a lot of scientists were  writing popular books.James Hopwood Jeans and Albert Einstein had books,  and Ernest Rutherford and others had books, so I read all of those and I was very  interested in them.And then I read about mathematics, and got all kinds of books  and was very interested in mathematics.And then at some point I got also very  interested, though, in literature.I read this book by this fellow Ford Madox Ford  called The March of Literature.

[翻譯]
此外，在那個時期，許多科學家都在寫通俗的書籍。詹姆斯·霍普伍德·詹斯和阿爾伯特·愛因斯坦都有書籍，而歐內斯特·卢瑟福和其他人也有書籍，所以我看過所有這些書籍，並對它們非常感興趣。然後我開始閱讀有關數學的書籍，對各種數學書籍非常感興趣。然後在某個時候，我也對文學產生了濃厚的興趣。我讀了福特·麥多克斯·福特的《文學進階》這本書。

So I started to read Fydor Dostoyevsky and Leo  Tolstoy and all of these things.And then I read Toynbee A Study of History when it  first came out in the late ‘30s.And I don’t know, you know.You’ve asked me why; I don’t know.- Q2: That’s your answer.You just kept reading.Marshall: Well, and I also read a lot of philosophy, like Alfred North Whitehead and  George Santayana and F.H.Bradley and sort of general treatments of intellectual  history and philosophy and so on.So I don’t know exactly why.

[翻譯]
所以我開始讀費奧多爾·陀思妥耶夫斯基和列夫·托爾斯泰等等。然後在30年代末，我讀了托因比的《歷史研究》。我不知道，你知道的。你問我為什麼；我不知道。- Q2: 這就是你的答案。你繼續閱讀。馬歇爾: 嗯，我還讀了很多哲學書，如阿爾弗雷德·北懷特黑德、喬治·桑塔亞納和F.H.布拉德利，以及一些關於知識史和哲學的一般著作。所以我不確切知道為什麼。

Q3: I don’t want to derail the conversation, but when there are people like you who  are kind of good at thinking abstractly, it’s so alluring, with a few simple assumptions and propositions and the strength of my own head, I can figure out the  whole universe and I don’t have to know anything.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q5: That’s the rationalistic, idealistic, fantasy nonsense.- Q3: No, no, but I see it all the time.

[翻譯]
問題3：我不想讓對話偏離主題，但是當有像你這樣擅長抽象思維的人時，很誘人，只需幾個簡單的假設和命題，再加上我自己的思維力，我就能理解整個宇宙，而不需要知道任何東西。- 馬歇爾：是的，就是這樣。- 問題5：那是理性主義、理想主義、幻想的胡言亂語。- 問題3：不，不，但我經常看到這種情況。

It’s what draws in some of the best students:  “We’ll have the most elegant model, the most parsimonious model, [indistinct]  the one with the fewest facts in it.”  
- Marshall: Yes, yes.- Q3: That’s what they say.- Marshall: That explains the most.- Q5: Even physics, maybe in some ways especially physics, requires you, if you’re  doing real science as opposed to the silly stuff, you’ve got to go back to the data  and you’ve got to take it seriously and you’ve got to keep [indistinct].

[翻譯]
這吸引了一些優秀學生：「我們將擁有最優雅的模型，最簡潔的模型，最省略的模型，最少事實的那一個。」
- 馬歇爾：是的，是的。- Q3：他們說這句話。- 馬歇爾：這解釋了最多。- Q5：甚至物理學，也許在某種程度上尤其是物理學，要求你，如果你在做真正的科學研究而不是傻瓜玩意，你必須回到數據，你必須認真對待它，你必須保持 [indistinct]。

--- 段落 220 (405 字元) ---
- Marshall: But it’s so alluring; I think the earlier proposition that the simplicity of  models makes them attractive is absolutely right.- Q5: No, no, I understand the allure.- Marshall: That’s why you get all these people to do that stuff.- Q5: I understand the allure.What I guess I’m pushing towards is a sense of what  Newton and company got started really being about, as opposed to what it  means.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：但它是如此迷人；我認為模型的簡單性使它們更具吸引力的主張是完全正確的。- Q5：不，不，我理解這種吸引力。- 馬歇爾：這就是為什麼你會讓所有這些人做那些事情的原因。- Q5：我理解這種吸引力。我猜想我所推動的是牛頓和他的同事們最初真正開始關心的事情，而不僅僅是它的意義。

--- 段落 221 (498 字元) ---
A really fascinating thing to spend the rest of your life fiddling around  with, but isn’t necessarily going to help you answer any of your questions?- Q3: No.I’m much more kind of [indistinct].We will agree that, properly done, there’s  this good relationship between research and abstract modeling.We also agree  that there are pathologies that people kind of get sucked off by the modeling  approach into these kinds of austere and… at any rate, exaggerations from reality.But Andy didn’t do it.

[翻譯]
一件非常迷人的事情，可以花一生的時間來玩弄，但不一定會幫助您回答任何問題嗎？- Q3：不。我更傾向於模糊不清。我們將同意，做好這個問題，研究和抽象建模之間存在良好的關係。我們還同意，人們有時會被建模方法吸引，陷入對這種嚴肅和… 無論如何，與現實的夸張。但安迪沒有這樣做。

--- 段落 222 (444 字元) ---
For some reason it didn’t happen to Andy, though if you  looked at his professional background [indistinct] interest in mathematics, training in economics and just this kind of way he thinks about these things…  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: You’d say, “This is going to be somebody who’s going to be another Oskar  Morgenstern or another Johnny von Neumann.” And, you know, just kind of push  game… He would be one of the premier game theoreticians.

[翻譯]
由於某種原因，這並沒有發生在安迪身上，盡管如果你看看他的專業背景[不清楚]對數學的興趣、在經濟學方面的培訓以及他對這些事情思考的方式…
- 馬歇爾：是的。
- Q3：你會說，“這將是另一個奧斯卡·莫根斯特恩或另一個約翰·馮·諾伊曼。” 你知道，只是推動遊戲…他將成為首屈一指的博弈論專家。

--- 段落 223 (312 字元) ---
Like Tom Schelling,  you know, used to go around and say, “You know, Andy Marshall was really one of  the few people who really understood game theory.” But it didn’t work out that way.- Q2: No, it did work out that way.Just Schelling didn’t understand how he [Marshall]  understood game theory.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
就像湯姆·舍林（Tom Schelling）一樣，你知道，他以前會四處說：“你知道，安迪·馬歇爾（Andy Marshall）真的是很少有人真正了解博弈論的人之一。”但事情並不是這樣。- Q2：不，事實確實是這樣的。只是舍林不明白他是如何理解博弈論的。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 224 (218 字元) ---
- Q3: [Quoting Schelling:] “I remember going out to RAND in 1959 and Andy Marshall  was doing this kind of transcendentally ordered preference schedules as a basis  for targeting the Soviet Union.”  Marshall: Yes, yes.

- Q5: Let me maybe go back to something much more familiar to some of the warm  bodies here at the table, which is the issue of, you’ve now got the balance paper  done, and it’s 120 pages long, it has three thousand footnotes, and it’s just wonderful, and Andy looks at it and says, “It may need a little restructuring.” [Indistinct]  And…  
- Q3: “Why don’t you move the words around on the page a little?”  
- Q4: I never had that problem.

[翻譯]
Q5: 讓我回到一些對這裡的一些熱情在座人員更為熟悉的問題，你現在已經完成了平衡文件，它長達120頁，有三千個註釋，非常出色，Andy看了看說，“可能需要稍微重新結構。”[不明確] 然後...  
Q3: "你為什麼不稍微調整一下頁面上文字的位置呢？"  
Q4: 我從來沒有遇到過那個問題。

--- 段落 226 (428 字元) ---
- Q5: But it’s the issue of openness to—There’s a whole bunch of different ways all  this stuff can be put together and lead to—And, you know, that’s sort of—I mean  that’s the approach that you really ought to take, and that’s the approach that the  first-rate scientists, whether it’s Darwin or whatever…  
- Marshall: Yeah.Well, there were two things.I don’t know, going back, exactly why I  had one of these characteristics.

[翻譯]
問題5：但這關乎開放性的問題——有許多不同的方式可以將所有這些東西組合起來，並導致——你知道，這種方式是你應該採取的方式，這也是一流科學家應該採取的方式，不管是達爾文還是其他人…
馬歇爾：是的。嗯，有兩件事。我不知道，回想起來，確切地為什麼我擁有這些特徵。

--- 段落 227 (307 字元) ---
But there were two areas that had certainly reinforced this or maybe led to it.One was the work on organizations, I mean in the…  
- Q3: Yeah, that was what seemed to be coming to me through these—I have six  themes—but whatever… 
Marshall: …particularly the stuff that people were doing at Carnegie-Mellon.

[翻譯]
但有兩個領域肯定加強了這一點，或者可能導致了這一點。其中一個是有關組織的工作，在... 
- Q3: 是的，這似乎是透過這六個主題中的其中一個傳達給我的，但無論如何... 
馬歇爾：...特別是人們在卡內基梅隆大學正在進行的工作。

--- 段落 228 (320 字元) ---
But then also the ethology thing, because there you saw in a very dramatic way  that up to a certain point people had all of these beliefs about animals and how  they behaved and so on, which turned out largely to be wrong.And how was  it changed?Well, it was some people who just went and watched what really  happened.

[翻譯]
但同樣的，行為學也是一個重要的議題，因為你可以在這裡非常戲劇性地看到，人們一直對動物和它們的行為等等有許多信念，而這些大部分都被證明是錯誤的。那麼這些信念是如何改變的呢？那些只是去觀察真實發生的事情的人改變了這些信念。

--- 段落 229 (427 字元) ---
And in fact, Konrad Lorenz edited a book that has a collected series of  papers—it’s not one of his major, mainline books—where he defends this notion  that at a certain stage it’s very important to just watch in great detail what happens, without preconceived notions, models and so on, just to see.36 He’s obviously responding to some criticism that people were maybe making at that time  or had made a number of years prior.

[翻譯]
其實，康拉德·洛倫茨編輯了一本收集了一系列論文的書籍——這不是他的主要著作之一——在這本書中他捍衛了一個觀點，即在某個階段僅僅細心觀察發生的事情是非常重要的，不要有預設觀念、模型等等，只是觀察。他顯然是在回應當時人們可能提出的一些批評，或是幾年前提出的批評。

--- 段落 230 (322 字元) ---
And what scientists discovered, of course,  and are continuing to discover is both how rich, complex are the lives of even  animals that don’t seem to have any marvelous brains or even small animals or so  on.I mean just how very rich, complex the whole thing is, particularly in the social  relations among these animals.

[翻譯]
科學家們當然發現了，並且繼續發現的是，即使是那些看似沒有令人驚奇的大腦的動物，甚至是小型動物等，它們的生活是多麼豐富而複雜的。我的意思是整個事物是多麼豐富而複雜，特別是在這些動物之間的社會關係中。

--- 段落 231 (468 字元) ---
So those two experiences of first getting interested in those for various reasons,  but then you get reinforced this notion of what’s really happening, how things  really function.- Q2: Was this before you went to RAND?- Marshall: No, this was after.- Q2: So, in a sense, maybe these special intelligence tickets would have allowed you  to view reality in the context of being around these guys creating models.You  had a chance to do the sanity check on these things.

[翻譯]
因此，這兩種首次對這些事情產生興趣的經驗，可能是出於各種原因，但然後你被強化了對真正發生的事情以及事物如何真正運作的概念。- 問2：這是在你去蘭德公司之前嗎？- 馬歇爾：不，這是之後。- 問2：所以從某種意義上說，也許這些特殊的情報通行證使你能夠在這些正在創建模型的人身邊觀察現實。你有機會對這些事情進行理智檢驗。

--- 段落 232 (449 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yeah, that may have reinforced it.- Q2: I mean I remember this one story of Alain Enthoven going up to you and finally  going, “Ah!Now I understand what you were talking about,” because you had  access to these compartments that he didn’t…  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: …so he was kind of wrong on a whole bunch of this stuff?- Marshall: Well, there certainly was that and then that particular aspect of my experience at RAND, I think.

[翻譯]
- Marshall：是的，也許那可能加強了這一點。- Q2：我的意思是，我記得有一個故事，阿兰·恩索文終於走到你身邊，開心地說：「啊！現在我終於明白你在談什麼了」，因為你能夠拿到他無法接觸的這些區域…
- Marshall：是的，沒錯。- Q2：…所以他對很多事情都有點錯嗎？- Marshall：嗯，當然有這種情況，以及在RAND的那段特定經歷，我想。

--- 段落 233 (455 字元) ---
But somehow—I don’t know, again, maybe it was living  through World War II, I don’t know—but I mean you just somehow get the sense  that you got to look at things, and also that surprising things can happen that  people didn’t believe.- Q3: Right.One of the things… I mean early on in your talk you said something like,  you said, “I’ve made this thing about knowing the other [indistinct]?It was always  possible to find something out about these things.

[翻譯]
但不知何故——也許是經歷過第二次世界大戰，我不知道——但我的意思是，你總是會有一種感覺，覺得自己必須要看清事情，還有一些出人意料的事情可能會發生，而這些事情大多數人是不相信的。- Q3：沒錯。在你的談話早期你說過類似的話，你說，“我一直強調了解其他事物的重要性，這是始終可以找到有關這些事情的資訊的。”

--- 段落 234 (386 字元) ---
” And most of us said, “Well,  the Soviet Union is a closed society, it’s got all these spies—so let’s make it up.”  But this kind of assumption you could go out and do some work, you’ll actually  find out something about this, which is partial and incomplete and imperfect but  better than…  
- Marshall: Yes, well that’s at the top of my list on the “beliefs” kind of thing over here.

[翻譯]
大多數人說：「蘇聯是一個封閉的社會，到處都是間諜，所以我們可以隨便瞎扯。」但這種假設如果去做些工作，實際上你會發現一些關於這件事情的東西，雖然是局部、不完整和不完美，但比起…馬歇爾: 是的，這是我關於這類"信念"的列表中的首位。

--- 段落 235 (491 字元) ---
- Q5: Well look, there’s another dimension of this it seems to me, and this sort of  occurred to me three or four pages back, at least in my notes.It’s this issue of continuing to come back to very basic questions.- Marshall: Yes.- Q5: Is it an intellectual style, or is it just me making an observation?I mean I’ve had  you drive me back to much more basic questions time and again, because I have  a tendency to get on to the fancy, sexy nuance and that’s the stuff that gets disconnected.

[翻譯]
Q5：嗯，看起來對我來說，這還有另一個層面，這個想法似乎是在三四頁之前出現的，至少在我的筆記裡。這就是不斷回到非常基本的問題這個問題。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q5：這是一種智力風格，還是僅僅是我在做一個觀察？我的意思是，我一直被你帶回更基本的問題，因為我有一個傾向，就是進入到花俏、性感的細微差別，而這些東西往往是不相關的。

--- 段落 236 (493 字元) ---
I mean I have strong tendencies in that direction.But you have always  and… Well, and the other dimension of it is just sticking with very basic questions  for very long periods of time.And it just seems to me, observationally, those are  fundamental intellectual characteristics, however they came about.I’m not sure  it’s knowable, although it’s interesting to try to probe.- Q2: Yeah, I mean you have this sort of intellectual tenacity, you know, don’t get  distracted and sidetracked, etc.

[翻譯]
我的意思是我很容易朝這個方向傾斜。但你總是...嗯，它的另一個層面就是對非常基本的問題堅持很長一段時間。觀察起來，這些基本的思維特徵是不可或缺的，不管它們是如何形成的。我不確定是否可知，雖然嘗試探究是很有趣的。- Q2: 是的，我的意思是你有一種智力的韌性，不會分心或被牽引。

--- 段落 237 (165 字元) ---
Just really stays… And that was my point earlier  about you staying with the long-term competition when other people were sort  of phasing that out.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
就是真的待下去......這就是我之前提到的，當其他人似乎正在淘汰長期競爭對手時，你決定留了下來。- 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 238 (434 字元) ---
- Q4: I think that at some point, Andy, when you go through editing, you probably  need to say more about the economics issue and strike a balance between your  comments early on that economics really matters, especially in the long run, and  comments that you make later on about game theory, understanding the opponent, and your examples… some of your comments about how simple-minded,  basically, economics can be.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
Q4：我認為在某個時候，安迪，在你進行編輯時，你可能需要更多地談論經濟問題，在早期關於經濟真的很重要，特別是從長遠來看的評論，以及後來關於博弈論、了解對手和你的例子的平衡... 有些關於經濟基本上可以多方面思考的話。- 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 239 (457 字元) ---
- Q4: I drew a strong message over the years from you about the fact that economics  really matter, but my sense was that economics as I was taught it, and raised, and  in reading about it wasn’t the kind of economics in 90 percent of the cases that  you were really sort of thinking about.- Marshall: Right.It matters the most in the sort of broad and kind of rough way at  this level of kind of macroeconomics.Of course, microeconomics is mainly nonsense.

[翻譯]
Q4：多年來，我從你那裡得到了一個關於經濟真的很重要的強烈信息，但我覺得我所學到的和成長中的經濟學，在閱讀相關資料時，並不是你真正思考的那種經濟學，在百分之九十的情況下都是這樣。- 馬歇爾：對，它在這個宏觀經濟學的層面上是最重要的，以一種廣泛和粗糙的方式。當然，微觀經濟學大部分都是胡說八道。

--- 段落 240 (474 字元) ---
But the sense that resources are scarce and limited is important.That’s part  of microeconomics, too, but I mean that at this macro level the point is that there’s  only so much to go around and if it gets soaked up with one area it’s not available  for others and that that matters, and that there really are these serious limits.Some of them can be bypassed for a time, but then you have these longer-term  consequences of having underinvested that got to get fixed later.

[翻譯]
但資源是稀缺和有限的感覺很重要。這也是微觀經濟學的一部分，但我指的是在宏觀層面上的重點是，資源有限，如果被某個領域吸收，其他領域就無法使用，這是很重要的，而且確實存在這些嚴重的限制。其中一些可以暫時被忽略，但之後你將因為投資不足而面臨長期後果。

--- 段落 241 (430 字元) ---
So there’s some  very broad kind of accounting balance that you got to pay attention to.- Q4: Coming back to the point about always coming back to some basic… occasionally going back to some basic questions: Taking a look at economics the way you  just described it is almost Samuelson Econ 101 thirty years ago, understanding  those issues with more richness than the way they subsequently were developed.- Marshall: Well, right.

[翻譯]
所以有一些非常廣泛的會計平衡，你必須要注意。問題4：回到一直回歸到一些基本...偶爾回到一些基本問題的觀點：從您剛描述的方式來看經濟，幾乎是三十年前的Samuelson Econ 101，理解這些問題比它們隨後發展的方式更豐富。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 242 (412 字元) ---
But going back to the basic questions, I guess my belief about  that is very much, I think, how useful that’s been to really try to think a lot about the questions and what they really are.What the really basic questions are is very  important.- Q4: Were there a set of economists that you found most interesting?As a class, for  example, did you find economic historians interesting people, or interesting work?

[翻譯]
但回到基本問題，我認為對於真正嘗試思考問題以及它們本質有多有用，我的信仰是非常深的。了解真正基本的問題是非常重要的。Q4：你發現哪些經濟學家最有趣？例如，你是否認為經濟史學家是有趣的人，或者認為他們的工作很有趣？

--- 段落 243 (366 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, again, I didn’t really do that much in economic history, although I  did some economic history.I thought when I was at the University of Chicago the  most interesting man was Frank Knight.He had some classes that were… He was  the person who was also very critical of much of economics, and so he would give  examples about how economics was crazy.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，再說一次，在經濟史方面我並沒有做太多，雖然我也做過一些經濟史研究。我覺得在芝加哥大學時最有趣的是Frank Knight教授。他教授的課程很有趣……他也是經濟學的批評者之一，經常會舉一些例子來說明經濟學有多無厘頭。

He said, “Every farmer knows that one  boy is worth one boy and two boys are worth about half a boy and three boys are  worth almost nothing,” whereas an economist would say three boys are worth  three boys.And that it was crazy because the family was really the most relevant  unit, not the individual, and so on.So I thought he was terrific.

[翻譯]
他說，“每個農夫都知道一個男孩值一個男孩，而兩個男孩大約相當於半個男孩，三個男孩幾乎等於沒有價值”，然而經濟學家會說三個男孩就是三個男孩。他覺得很瘋狂，因為家庭才是最相關的單位，而不是個人等等。所以我覺得他很棒。

Now I actually  spent a lot of my time, however, in the kind of mathematical statistics and making  models estimating… I wrote my master’s thesis on a test for the accuracy of predictions of a model that had been created, and things like that.- Q4: At this point in time were you a devoted modeler?- Marshall: No, I was more interested in the statistics of the thing.And I was interested in kind of the logical positivists… and so on.

[翻譯]
現在，我實際上花了很多時間在數理統計和建立模型的工作上...我寫了我的碩士論文關於一個已經建立的模型預測準確性的測試，等等。問題4：當時你是一個專注於建模的人嗎？- 馬歇爾：不，我更感興趣的是事物的統計。我對邏輯實證主義者...等等感興趣。

--- 段落 246 (455 字元) ---
I finally decided that it wasn’t  clear that these models were saying anything about the economy, really.What  they were were predictions of the next number that would appear in the Commerce  Department’s summary of the thing.I mean that’s as far as you could go.- Q3: Epiphenomena.- Marshall: Yes.Well, it’s supposed to be related to the reality, but the Commerce  Department number is what it was predicting, not necessarily anything about the  economy.

[翻譯]
我最終決定這些模型並未清楚地說明任何與經濟有關的事情。它們只是預測在商務部門對事物的摘要中接下來會出現的數字。我的意思是，這就是它們所能預測的範圍。- Q3: 副次現象。- 馬歇爾：是的。嗯，它應該與現實有關，但這些模型預測的是商務部門的數字，並不必然與經濟有關。

--- 段落 247 (438 字元) ---
- Q5: Would you be inclined to say anything more about the issue of limits?I mean I  have sort of, I guess, odd views about the 20th century, because a lot of people  read the 20th century as there are absolutely no limits, there’s nothing we can’t  do.There’s an alternative reading in a lot of fields.There is, like mathematics that  suggest that there are lots of limits out there, actually, as a matter of fact, if you  pay attention.

[翻譯]
Q5：您是否願意再多談一些關於限制的問題？我的意思是，我對於二十世紀有一些奇怪的觀點，因為許多人認為在二十世紀裡絕對沒有限制，沒有我們做不到的事情。在許多領域中有另一種觀點。實際上，比如數學，它表明其實有許多限制存在，只要你留意的話。

--- 段落 248 (483 字元) ---
And some of them you can, say, you can wheel around to some  extent.Some of them you can’t do much with.I mean does that have any…  
- Marshall: No, I know about that, and certainly one of the most fruitful ways of thinking about things has been focused on these kind of limits, like conservation of  energy and all these kinds of things, but then exclude lots of possibilities.So I’ve  been aware of that, but I guess I wouldn’t say that’s played a big role in my intellectual life.

[翻譯]
有些你可以輪轉到一定程度。有些你無法做太多。我的意思是這有沒有...？

- 馬歇爾：不，我知道這個，肯定有一種思考方式是專注於這些界限，比如能量守恆和所有這些類型的事情，但這也排除了很多可能性。我意識到這一點，但我想我不能說這在我的思想生活中扮演了重要角色。

--- 段落 249 (351 字元) ---
I guess that what has interested me is the kind of narrowness of most  of the [indistinct] in the political and economics fields and so on, the narrowness  of most of the thinking about things, which tends to assume a whole bunch  of things can’t happen or are unlikely, which if you look at history, history says  happen all the time.So there’s that.

[翻譯]
我想我感興趣的是政治、經濟等領域大部分思維的狹窄，大多數對事情的看法都很狹隘，傾向於假設很多事情不可能發生或不太可能發生，但如果你看過歷史，歷史告訴我們這樣的事情一直都在發生。這就是我的感想。

--- 段落 250 (464 字元) ---
So I’ve been mainly, I’d say, on the side that  believes reality and the possibilities or “unlikely” events are far richer than what  the theorizing and the standard thinking tends to suggest.Let me go on with these beliefs.The first one, as we’ve already talked about, is  that some progress can be made on almost any question, that even the hardest  questions you can make some headway on or be somewhat better off than just  sitting back and not doing anything.

[翻譯]
所以，我主要是站在相信現實和可能性或「不太可能」事件比理論和標準思維所建議的更豐富的一邊。讓我繼續談談這些信念。我們已經談到的第一個信念是，幾乎任何問題都可以取得一些進展，即使是最難的問題，你也可以有所進展，或比坐在那裡什麼都不做要好一些。

--- 段落 251 (394 字元) ---
- Q2: That’s not a prediction, however.That’s an observation.- Marshall: Yes.Right.- Q2: We’ve shown that there are some areas that are remarkably resilient, like counter-command-and-control and those kinds of things in terms of analyzing…  
- Marshall: Well, I don’t mean progress in the sense of fixing it, but intellectual progress.- Q2: I mean understanding.- Marshall: Understanding, yeah.

[翻譯]
- Q2: 這並不是一個預測，而是一個觀察。
- Marshall: 是的，對。
- Q2: 我們已經表明有一些地區非常有彈性，比如反指揮和控制等方面，就分析而言…
- Marshall: 我不是指進步在修復上，而是在思想上的進步。
- Q2: 我指的是理解。
- Marshall: 理解，對。

--- 段落 252 (467 字元) ---
- Q2: I mean we struggled for years and years to understand…  
- Marshall: Well, yes, there are some areas in which that’s right.But on the other  hand, I don’t think really serious systematic efforts have been made.- Q3: You probably have some notion of just what a fearless statement that is.- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: Because I’m in the business about working with young researchers at the beginning and they would say, “No!What about the risk that it’ll be a dead end?

[翻譯]
- Q2: 我的意思是，多年來我們一直努力理解...
- 馬歇爾：是的，在某些方面是對的。但另一方面，我認為並沒有真正嚴肅的系統性努力。
- Q3：你可能對這個勇敢的聲明有一些概念。
- 馬歇爾：是的。
- Q3：因為我一直從事與年輕研究人員合作的業務，他們可能會說，“不！但風險呢？有可能走上死胡同嗎？”。

--- 段落 253 (487 字元) ---
What  about the risk that I’ll have spent all these years and nothing will come out?” …  and the lack of willingness to kind of take a chance and kind of… They’re ruled by  their fears.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q5: But you always learn lots from dead ends.- Q3: Absolutely true, but that’s not the attitude that they take.They want safe topics  which… there’s an established method for finding out this stuff and you’re guaranteed of some boring payoff, but you get some payoff.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
“我花了這麼多年的時間，最後可能什麼也沒有成果呢？”...以及缺乏願意冒險的意願和...他們被他們的恐懼所控制。- 馬歇爾：是的。- 問題5: 但你總是從死胡同中學到很多東西。- 問題3: 當然是真的，但這不是他們採取的態度。他們想要安全的話題...有一種已經建立的方法來找到這些信息，你保證會得到一些無聊的回報，但你會得到一些回報。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 254 (466 字元) ---
- Q4: Let me ask you this: Does that whole… Would you apply that also to Ph.D.students who live in fear that they will spend two years of their lives and find out  their topic is dead?- Q3: I guess I’m contrasting the current crop of students that I work with, with some  of the people that I knew, and Andy knew some of them… more interesting academic friends who said, “Yeah, I don’t care.I mean it’s some interesting stuff.If I  work hard I’ll find out something.

[翻譯]
問題4：讓我問你這個問題：對於那些生活在恐懼中的博士生，他們擔心會花費兩年的時間才發現他們所研究的主題已經過時，你也會將這樣的態度應用嗎？
問題3：我想我正在對比我現在與之合作的一批學生，與我認識的一些人，安迪也認識其中一些……更有趣的學術朋友們與之形成對照，他們說：“是的，我不在乎。這是一些有趣的東西。如果我努力工作，我會發現一些東西。”

”  
- Marshall: Yeah, that’s right.- Q3: [Indistinct] “And I don’t know exactly how I’m going to do it, but something will  come out of it.”  
- Marshall: But I’m also thinking of it a bit from kind of the practical side, I mean  practical in the sense of putting you in a position to more intelligently speculate, a little bit, on one area.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q3：［不清楚］"我不知道自己要如何做，但一定會有一些結果。"  
- 馬歇爾：但我也從一個實際的角度來考慮這個問題，我的意思是在讓你更聰明地對一個領域進行一點點推測的意義上。

--- 段落 256 (465 字元) ---
Again, one of the notes I have here says one of the things  that first made me feel that much of the work on the Soviet economy was not  what it ought to be was in the middle ‘50s, when Loftus and I had some questions  about the economy and how it related to the defense effort.And we asked some  of the RAND people that were at the center of this effort and they essentially  refused to answer, to even try to answer these hard questions.- Q2: Was it too hard or…?

[翻譯]
再次，我在這裡有一條筆記提到的一件事情，讓我一開始感覺蘇聯經濟工作大部分都不像該有的樣子，是在50年代中期時，當我和洛夫特斯對經濟和其與國防努力的關係有一些問題。我們向參與這個努力的蘭德人提問，他們基本上拒絕回答，甚至嘗試回答這些艱難的問題。- Q2：是因為太難還是…？

--- 段落 257 (408 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, yes, too uncertain, too this, too that; “We can’t make an estimate.”  And it was exasperating.My sense was that it was kind of unclear what this effort  was all about if it wouldn’t even try to answer these very fundamental questions.And, again, I talked about this before, that it seems to me that even not-so-good  answers to good questions are better than good answers to poor questions.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：是的，太不確定了，太這個，太那個；“我們無法做出估計。”這真的讓人惱火。我覺得如果連這些非常基本的問題都不願意嘗試回答，那麼這個努力到底是為了什麼其實蠻不清楚的。再次重申，我之前談過這個問題，對我來說，甚至是對好問題的不太好的回答都比對爛問題的好回答更好。

--- 段落 258 (493 字元) ---
And  that, along with this “it’s possible to make progress on almost anything” belief is, I  think, very important as a set of beliefs in the way of going about things.Then I guess the second thing is—which overlaps a little bit with some of the  other things I said before—about the character of man or mankind.I mean the  liberal view of man is just unbelievable.I don’t know where I came upon that, but  fairly early I decided it was just not so.Man’s character is the product of evolution.

[翻譯]
同時，我認為這種「幾乎任何事情都有可能取得進展」的信念也非常重要，這是在做事情時的一套信念。然後我認為第二點是，這點與我之前提到的一些其他事情有一些重疊-關於人類性格的部分。我的意思是，對人類的自由觀點真是難以置信。我不知道我從哪裡得到這個看法，但很早以前我就認為這並非如此。人類的性格是進化的產物。

--- 段落 259 (434 字元) ---
There are limits to rationality, and the role of honor and passions is important.In  other cases I’ve mentioned this thing of Herbert Goldhamer’s…  
- Q4: Is it, however, an area in which progress is still possible?- Marshall: About what?About understanding the character of man?I would say that  progress in understanding the character of man is possible.I don’t think it would  end up going down the standard kind of view of things.

[翻譯]
理性是有限度的，而榮譽和激情的作用至關重要。在其他情況下，我提到了赫伯特·戈德哈默的這件事…  
- Q4：然而，在這個領域，進步是可能的嗎？- 馬歇爾：關於什麼？關於理解人的性格？我會說理解人的性格是可能的。我不認為這會最終走向標準的觀點。

--- 段落 260 (462 字元) ---
So, it’s certainly related to my interest in the whole ethology area.But it goes  beyond that, I think.Well, I suppose there’s that, and I’ve mentioned I know before  this observation of Goldhamer at one point early on in connection with these  people who were looking at air defenses, doing all their calculations, and he pointed  out that what was left out was that some pilots would ram enemy airplanes.Well, at any rate, status, dominance—all very important.

[翻譯]
所以，這肯定跟我對整個動物行為學領域的興趣有關。但我認為它還超越了這一點。嗯，我想這是其中一個原因，我之前提到過，Goldhamer曾經在某個時候早期觀察過這些人在研究防空防禦時做所有的計算，他指出被忽略的一點是一些飛行員會撞擊敵方飛機。無論如何，地位、支配力都非常重要。

--- 段落 261 (330 字元) ---
And so, I think all of this  is very important in thinking about the general character of the future.[gap for tape change, Marshall comments on his belief that war has a prominent  future]  
- Marshall: And then the third one of the beliefs is, there are real experts.I mean that  there are some people who really are exceptional.

[翻譯]
因此，我認為所有這些對於思考未來的整體性格非常重要。[更換錄音帶時的空隙，馬歇爾就他認為戰爭在未來具有突出地位表達了觀點]
- 馬歇爾：然後第三個信念是，真的有專家。我的意思是，有些人確實是非凡的。

--- 段落 262 (480 字元) ---
Some of it’s just that they’re  smart—there are some people that are just dramatically smarter, more intelligent  than others, or have some kind of training or feel for things that other people  don’t have.I think I’ve mentioned this one case of—again, it comes from Herman  Kahn and came out of a discussion that he and I would get into.We’d concocted  various estimates to prove the failure of the standard economics, which tended  to say people are paid their marginal product.

[翻譯]
有些人只是聰明 - 有些人比其他人明顯地更聰明，更有智慧，或者具有某種訓練或對事物有獨特的感知。我想我已經提到過一個案例 - 再次，這是來自赫爾曼·卡恩，是我們常常會進行討論的話題。我們想出各種估計，以證明標準經濟學的失敗，標準經濟學傾向於認為人們得到的是他們的邊際產品價值。

--- 段落 263 (481 字元) ---
He was doing Monte Carlo calculations in connection with the bomb designs and noted that you could make a case  here with Herman Kahn, four or five other people, lots of computing time—at a time when computing time was very expensive to do these things—and Hans  Bethe, on the other hand, who could do these things with paper and pencil.And it’s almost as though there were some of these very best physicists that had a  pipeline to God about how the world really was put together.

[翻譯]
他正在進行與炸彈設計相關的蒙特卡羅計算，並指出這裡可以與赫爾曼·卡恩以及其他四五個人進行論證，需要大量的計算時間──在計算時間非常昂貴的情況下進行這些事情──而另一方面，漢斯·貝蒂，可以用紙和鉛筆進行這些事情。幾乎有一些最優秀的物理學家似乎能夠與上苍取得關於世界是如何真正組成的管道。

--- 段落 264 (321 字元) ---
Because all of these  calculations that these people have to make are approximations—you have to  choose the right approximation or the right…Many of them were, say, integrating  under some complex surface and you could get the answer approximately by…  because they have a lot of it concentrated in some particular spot.

[翻譯]
因為這些人必須進行的所有計算都是近似值 - 你必須選擇正確的近似值或正確的...其中許多人是在某些複雜表面下積分，你可以通過...來近似獲得答案，因為他們有很多資料集中在某個特定位置。

--- 段落 265 (359 字元) ---
If you know where  that spot is, then you just calculate in the area around it, but you got to know  where that spot is in this complex surface, and there are these people who time  after time know.But there are all different kinds and so it’s very important to find  these people and pay attention to them.And it happens throughout one’s experience, I think.

[翻譯]
如果你知道那個位置在哪裡，那麼你只需要計算周圍的面積，但你必須知道那個位置在這個複雜的表面上，而這些人一次又一次地知道。但這些人各有不同，因此找到這些人並注意他們非常重要。我認為這會在一個人的經驗中不斷發生。

--- 段落 266 (481 字元) ---
In the end, it seems to me that one of the things in one’s life is to  calibrate people and then pay attention to those people who have some significant  amount of this superior insight into how things really are.The thing that was really  wonderful about RAND in the ‘50s was there were quite an unusual number of those  people that somehow or another had been brought there in the Social Sciences  Division.You had people like Goldhamer or Nathan Leites, in his particular areas.

[翻譯]
最後，對我來說，人生中的一件事情就是校準他人，然後留意那些對事物真實情況有較高洞察力的人。在上世紀50年代，RAND真正了不起的地方就在於社會科學部門聚集了相當不尋常的一群這樣的人。像是Goldhamer或者在他特定領域的Nathan Leites這樣的人。

--- 段落 267 (439 字元) ---
- Q2: Well, they’re all in particular areas.- Marshall: Yeah, right, they’re not universal things.- Q2: So Goldhamer and Leites and who else would you put in that category?- Marshall: Well, I don’t know who they are in some of the other areas.I mean like  physics, you’d have to have somebody like Herman Kahn, who might have been  able to identify them in that area.But the point is that there are people who really  are just exceptional.

[翻譯]
問2：嗯，它們都是在特定領域。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯，它們不是普遍的事物。- 問2：那麼Goldhamer和Leites還有誰會放在這個類別裡？- 馬歇爾：嗯，我不知道其他領域的人是誰。我的意思是像物理學，你可能要有像赫爾曼·康恩這樣的人，他可能能夠在該領域識別出他們。但關鍵是有些人真的是非常傑出。

--- 段落 268 (454 字元) ---
- Q3: You said you’d calibrate them, by which I assume you meant you kept track of  whether or not they were right more often than wrong.- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: Could you talk a little bit more about that?Because very often the people that  you have found to be real experts were not the people who were nominally the  experts…  
- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q3: …so obviously the conventional scoring and reward system doesn’t…  
- Marshall: Yes, that’s true.

[翻譯]
Q3: 你說過你會校正他們，我想這意味著你會記錄他們是對還是錯的次數。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q3: 你能再多談一些嗎？因為很常見的情況是，你發現真正的專家往往不是名義上的專家...- 馬歇爾：是的，對。- Q3: ...所以顯然傳統的評分和獎勵系統不...- 馬歇爾：是的，這是真的。

--- 段落 269 (414 字元) ---
Q3: I think Lionel Tiger’s status among anthropologists is… he’s not… he’s too popular, he’s too funny or something like that.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: So how do you calibrate?- Marshall: I don’t know, exactly.Well, in some cases you would determine whether  they’re a steady source of insight in some things.But another thing is with  Goldhamer and Leites, people like that, they would have written papers and so on.

[翻譯]
Q3: 我認為對於人類學家來說，Lionel Tiger的地位是...他不是...他太受歡迎了，或者他太有趣之類的。- 馬歇爾: 是的。- Q3: 那你如何校準呢？- 馬歇爾: 我不確定，有些情況下你可以確定他們是否在某些方面是穩定的洞察力來源。但另一個方面，像Goldhamer和Leites這樣的人，他們可能已經寫過論文等等。

--- 段落 270 (349 字元) ---
- Q3: I remember you once saying about Leites… You sort of had been keeping track  of his views on the Soviet Union for 30 years…  
- Marshall: Yes.- Q3: …reasonably credible [indistinct].So that was a more straightforward case.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q3: In some of these cases it’s a little more difficult to score.- Marshall: Yeah, that’s true.

[翻譯]
Q3: 我記得你曾經提到過 Leites… 你似乎在過去30年一直關注他對蘇聯的觀點…  
Marshall: 是的。  
Q3: …相當可信[不清晰]。所以這是一個比較直接的案例。  
Marshall: 是的，對。  
Q3: 在某些案例中，要評分可能會更加困難。  
Marshall: 是的，這是真的。

--- 段落 271 (489 字元) ---
- Q2: I recall when I was here one of the things that I was always taken by was you  would always find these guys that were, like, the Central Intelligence Agency analysts in the bowels of the Agency that, you know, they’d been working on this paper  for three years and it never got published, because nobody could ever get consensus on it, but it was very, very important and seemed to be very, very interesting.Like Joe Backhofen and the work he was doing on Soviet fuel-air explosives.

[翻譯]
Q2：我記得以前在這裡時，我總是被一些人深深吸引，他們都是中央情報局的分析師，你知道，他們已經在這份文件上工作了三年，但它從來沒有發表過，因為沒有人能夠達成共識，但這是非常非常重要的，似乎也非常有趣。就像喬·巴克霍芬（Joe Backhofen）以及他對蘇聯燃料空氣炸彈的研究工作一樣。

--- 段落 272 (448 字元) ---
Marshall: Right.- Q2: He could never get the darn thing published, but he knew enough to find you  or you found him.- Marshall: Well, I think a lot of that is if you are obviously open to that, or you’re in a  high enough place—or people have the illusion you’re in a high enough place—  they seek you out.But it has to be associated with a willingness to listen and give  a hearing to people that have a nonstandard kind of view or some new thing.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：對。- 問題2：他永遠無法讓該死的東西出版，但他知道足夠找到你，或者你找到了他。- 馬歇爾：我認為其中很大一部分是，如果你顯然對此持開放態度，或者你處在足夠高的位置，或者人們有一種錯覺認為你處於足夠高的位置，他們會尋找你。但這必須與願意聆聽和給予一個機會聽取那些持有非標準觀點或新見解的人有關。

--- 段落 273 (397 字元) ---
- Q2: So you don’t find them, you create an opportunity for them to find you?Then  you have to be smart enough to figure out that they’ve found you.- Marshall: Right.At any rate, that’s what I came up with in my list of beliefs.- Q4: Let me raise one.It would seem to me that you… as long as I’ve known you,  have been very interested in what I would just call “strategy.”  
- Marshall: Yes, very.

[翻譯]
- Q2: 所以你不是找到他們，而是為他們找到你創造機會？然後你必須足夠聰明，能夠發現他們已經找到你。- Marshall: 沒錯。無論如何，在我的信念清單中，這就是我得出的結論。- Q4: 讓我提出一個問題。在我認識你的時間裡，你似乎對所謂的“戰略”非常感興趣。- Marshall: 是的，非常。

--- 段落 274 (429 字元) ---
- Q4: Now it is clearly built into some of your comments, like long-term perspective,  the notions of competition…  Marshall: Right.- Q4: But it has struck me that you had—at least for the last… since I’ve known you—  sort of this enduring interest in strategy, how you think strategically…  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q4: …whether we are thinking about the right kinds… thinking about strategy the  correct way, and so on and so forth.

[翻譯]
Q4：現在您的一些評論中明顯地已經涵蓋了長期的觀點，競爭的概念... 馬歇爾：對。Q4：但讓我感到驚訝的是，您至少在過去...自從我認識您以來，似乎對戰略有著持久的興趣，您如何從戰略角度思考... 馬歇爾：是的。Q4：...無論我們是否在思考正確的方法，思考戰略的正確方式等等。

--- 段落 275 (393 字元) ---
And yet you didn’t really put that down as  one of…  
- Marshall: Well, maybe I should have.Certainly I’m very interested in that.- Q4: As a belief?- Marshall: Again, I guess in a more visible, concrete way, it came out of the early  RAND experience.Because in the immediate postwar period there was this whole issue of how are we going to deal with Soviets, what our strategy was going to be.

[翻譯]
然而，你並沒有真的將那視為其中的一個…  
- 馬歇爾：也許我應該這麼做。當然，我對這個非常感興趣。  
- Q4：作為一種信仰嗎？  
- 馬歇爾：再說一次，在一個更明顯、具體的方式上，這源自早期蘭德（RAND）的經驗。因為在戰後初期，有這個整個問題，我們該如何應對蘇聯，我們的戰略會是什麼。

--- 段落 276 (469 字元) ---
And then I first got into this business of organizational behavior, and got onto Jim  March and company—it was the very late ‘50s.But then I said, “Well, who else is  working on organizations?” and went to the Harvard Business School.There I first  came across these ideas that were being developed on business policy, business  strategy, and got very interested in picking up what they were saying.That all  continued and it had, again, a big impact on the longer run.

[翻譯]
後來，我首次涉足組織行為的領域，並開始研究吉姆·馬奇等人的工作，這是在1950年代後期。但後來我問自己：「還有誰在研究組織呢？」於是我去了哈佛商學院。在那裡，我首次接觸到正在發展的有關商業政策、商業戰略的想法，並對他們所說的內容非常感興趣。這些研究一直持續下去，對我長遠來看產生了巨大影響。

- Q2: Did you develop a strategy for how you were going operate in the U.S.government?I mean, did you look at the U.S.government as this large, complex organization and develop a plan about how you were going to proceed if you were  going to be successful?And if you did, what was the strategy?- Marshall: Well, to some extent I did.When I first picked Chip Pickett to come to  work for me it was because he had been up at the Harvard Business School and  I talked to C.

[翻譯]
問2：你是否制定了一項計劃，針對在美國政府中的操作？我的意思是，你是否把美國政府視為一個龐大、複雜的組織，並制定了一個計劃，關於如果你成功了你將如何繼續進行？如果是的話，你的策略是什麼？- 馬歇爾：在某種程度上，我確實有。當我第一次挑選契普·皮克特來為我工作時，那是因為他曾在哈佛商學院學習，我跟C.进行了交談。

--- 段落 278 (442 字元) ---
Roland Christensen, who was in this strategy business.And I picked  Chip because at that point one of the main tasks I had from Henry Kissinger was  following the implementation of the Nixon reorganization of the intelligence  community.So I wanted someone with this business school strategy background,  and someone who was interested in organizations, because what we were going  to try to do was change the behavior of these organizations.

[翻譯]
羅蘭·克里斯滕森在戰略業務中很有造詣。我選擇了奇普，因為在那時，我的主要任務之一是跟進尼克松對情報社區的重組實施。所以我想找一個有商學戰略背景的人，以及對組織感興趣的人，因為我們要嘗試改變這些組織的行為。

--- 段落 279 (489 字元) ---
And so the question  was one of sitting up there and listening to their lying protestations of how they  worked for the President and, of course, they would do whatever he wanted, and  so on.You were going to need some kind of strategy for changing them and you  had to be clever about that and so on.So I very much had that view, based on my  earlier interest in organizations and all of that.So I was interested in it in that way,  that was very conscious, to have that kind of approach.

[翻譯]
所以問題是坐在那裡聽他們虛偽地聲稱他們為總統工作，當然，他們將會做他想要的事情等等。你需要某種改變他們的策略，你必須聰明處理。因此，基於我對組織的早期興趣，我非常專注於這個觀點。我以這種方式對此感興趣，這是非常有意識的，我有這種方法。

Then as we shifted over to the Pentagon pretty exclusively it was the assessment thing… Initially, we couldn’t get the assessment stuff going when I was at  the National Security Council because the Department of Defense really didn’t  want to do it and there was an elaborate rigamarole to even get the whole thing  started.

[翻譯]
當我們專注於五角大樓時，開始進行評估。起初，當我在國家安全委員會時，我們無法啟動評估工作，因為國防部真的不想去做，甚至要啟動整個過程已經變得非常繁瑣。

When I came over here, I don’t think I developed a very systematic, conscious strategy, but I certainly knew that there were things that you didn’t want  to do if you were going to survive.That certainly affected this notion of sticking to  diagnosis; that was a very conscious part of the strategy.

當我來到這裡時，我不認為我發展了一個非常系統化、有意識的策略，但我確實知道如果要生存下去就不應該做些什麼。這肯定影響了堅持診斷這一概念；這是策略中非常有意識的一部分。

Based also on my experience from the RAND period I also thought that if you’re really going to try to affect  things—while it’s slower in some sense—the thing to aim for is changing the way  people think about certain problems, having them adopt your vocabulary, and so  on, etc.It also was important to take a longer-term view of things, and, in fact, not  to be very anxious or focused on achieving some great big, immediate changes.

[翻譯]
根據我在蘭德時期的經驗，我也認為，如果你真的想要改變事物的話，雖然它在某種意義上進展緩慢，但應該朝著改變人們對某些問題的看法、讓他們採納你的詞彙等目標努力。同時，也很重要的是對事物採取較長期的觀點，實際上，不要過於焦慮或專注於實現一些巨大、立即的改變。

- Q2: I think we could all sit down and write the Andy Marshall strategy: keep a low  profile; don’t mess with programmatics and budgets; find smart people in important places, whether it’s your nominal boss or not, to service with your product;  have a little office on the A-ring of the Pentagon that’s got lousy furniture and have  an office half the size that you’re supposed to have; have a very small staff; none of  the trappings of power.

[翻譯]
我認為我們都可以坐下來寫出安迪·馬歇爾策略：保持低調；不要干擾技術方面和預算方面；找到重要位置上的聰明人，無論是不是你名義上的老闆，為你的產品提供服務；在五角大樓A環有一個小辦公室，傢俱糟糕，辦公室的大小只有你應該有的一半大小；只有一個非常小的員工團隊；沒有任何權力的象徵。

I think based on working here, we could all kind of write  out… Now, did you sit down and think about those kinds of things consciously and purposefully and implement them, or did you just kind of evolve into those,  or did you understand them intuitively?- Marshall: I think it was more I understood that intuitively.People used to talk about  getting me up in the E-ring, which was farthest from my desire, I mean…  
- Q4: I never presumed you were actually thinking that way about it.

[翻譯]
我認為基於在這裡工作的經驗，我們都能夠寫出來... 現在，你是坐下來思考這些事情並刻意實施，還是逐漸演變成這樣，或者你是靈感的理解？- 馬歇爾：我想更多的是我直覺地理解這些。以前人們常常說要把我帶到E環，這與我的期望背道而馳，我是認真的... 
- Q4：我從來沒假設過你真的是那樣想的。

I think that the  view early on among us was just interesting [indistinct].- Marshall: Well, that’s true.- Q4: I can remember secretaries that screwed themselves into the ceiling over the  [indistinct] Mr.Marshall [indistinct]…James Roche also doing the same thing….which subtly, probably it made you even more useful because you couldn’t be  interpreted as a threat.It might be really an interesting… It’s a great question.

[翻譯]
我認為我們早期的看法只是有趣的。- 馬歇爾：是的，這是真的。- Q4：我還記得秘書們在天花板上把自己搞得很辛苦……而馬歇爾先生也是……詹姆斯·羅奇也做同樣的事情……這可能更使你變得更有用，因為你不會被視為威脅。這可能真的很有趣……這是一個很好的問題。

It would be almost an  unwritable chapter, but it would be really interesting to speculate on why Andy  Marshall as an institution stayed in the Defense Department for as long as he did.I have an…always believing in one of your earlier precepts about [indistinct]  should be based on fact and reality, I have one good solid data point to indicate  that he actually had a fairly strong sense of risk.

[翻譯]
這個章節幾乎無法寫出來，但推測為什麼安迪·馬歇爾作為一個機構留在國防部這麼長時間真的很有趣。我一直堅信你早期所提出的關於[不清楚]應該建立在事實和現實基礎上的法則之一，我有一個非常有力的數據點表明他實際上對風險有相當強烈的感知力。

And that is that my next-door  neighbor was the president of Cort rental furniture, and some years ago, while we  were playing bridge, he said, “You know, I run a rental operation here in town.” He  said, “You know, we got a guy who’s been renting furniture from us for 15 years.”  He says, “You can’t [indistinct].He’s never bought it.” He says, “You can’t believe  this.” I say, “What’s his name?” He says, “Andy Marshall.” I said, “Hey, I know that guy.

- Marshall: Well, I always thought that I would leave in a few years.I had no plan that  would keep me here very long.- Q2: In ways that contributed to your longevity.- Marshall: Yeah, that’s true, I mean…  
- Q2: Because you always were planning to leave and you had a home.- Marshall: And a related thing was that it certainly, was probably very important  that I didn’t have any children and always had a reasonable amount of money;  it didn’t matter to me whether I had the job or not.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：嗯，我一直覺得我會在幾年內離開。我沒有計劃讓我在這裡久留。

- Q2：以某種方式有助於您的長壽。

- 馬歇爾：是的，這是真的，我想...

- Q2：因為您一直都在計劃離開，並且有一個家。

- 馬歇爾：和一個相關的事情是，很可能我沒有孩子並且總是有一個足夠的金錢，這肯定是非常重要的，對我來說是否有這份工作並不重要。

It was really a matter of, you  know, I would feel badly about if I no longer were Director of Net Assessment,  but it was not anything that was going to ruin my life or anything.But also, from  everything I saw at RAND, where I was sort of in the same business of trying to do  studies and change the way people look at things, I knew that you had to take a  very long-term view.This notion that you could write something as though it’s  kind of like a best-seller just doesn’t pay off.

[翻譯]
這確實是一個問題，你知道，如果我不再擔任網絡評估主任，我會感到很遺憾，但這並不會毀掉我的生活。但是，從我在蘭德研究所看到的一切來看，我在研究和改變人們觀點方面也是在同一行業，我知道你必須採取非常長遠的觀點。這種認為你可以寫一些像暢銷書一樣的東西的觀念根本沒有回報。

- Q4: I think that’s another one of your observations that you didn’t make, because I  have it down here… fame, which is not… I mean I realize it’s in a way brought up  by your comment… But it’s this notion that seems to be embedded in your thinking over the years… some people would call it patience, but my view is… you just articulated it… it’s this notion that if you really want to change the way the intellectual horizon works, you have to be prepared for a long-haul effort.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
問題四：我覺得這是你未做出的另一個觀察，因為我有記下來...名聲，這並不...我意識到你的評論在某種程度上提起了這個問題...但這個觀念似乎一直存在於你多年的思考中...有些人會稱之為耐心，但我的看法是...你剛剛表達了它...這是一個觀念，如果你真的想改變知識領域運作的方式，你必須為長期的努力做好準備。- 馬歇爾：是的。

Also, I guess it’s an advantage not to have ambitions to have some  prominent or truly high-ranking job.I mean it doesn’t mean anything to me.It’s  not anything I would care about.- Q4: Let me draw you back to the strategic perspective.

[翻譯]
同時，我想不懷抱成為一些顯要或真正高級職位的抱負可能是一個優勢。我的意思是這對我來說並不重要，這不是我在意的事情。- 問題四：讓我再次引導你回到戰略的角度。

--- 段落 293 (481 字元) ---
My sense is that the real  sort of growth in your interest in strategy comes [indistinct] comes somewhere  in the… begins in the late ‘70s, mid-to-late ‘70s, when Jim Roche is here and you  actually… you do some things for the Chief of Naval Operations…  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q4: …when I start thinking of the examples of you getting deeply involved in strategy, strategic notions, concepts and so on and so forth, I didn’t see that much evidence of it in the ‘72 to ‘75 time frame.

[翻譯]
我的感覺是，你對戰略的興趣真正增長的時候開始於70年代後期，約在70年代中期到晚期，當吉姆·羅奇在這裡時，你實際上...為海軍作戰司令部做了一些事情...
- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q4：當我回想起你深度參與戰略、戰略概念等方面的例子時，我在1972年至1975年的時間範圍內沒有看到太多證據。

--- 段落 294 (386 字元) ---
Starting around ‘75 is when I think things  began to occur.- Marshall: Well, I think that’s right, except that there was this whole antecedent  period and the stuff I did at RAND and so on, which was very much of that same  sort.And as I mentioned, I’d been very interested in the stuff at the Harvard  Business School, developing certainly in the ‘60s.So I was very interested in that.

[翻譯]
從大約1975年開始，我認為事情開始發生。 - 馬歇爾: 嗯，我認為這是對的，除了之前的一段時間，還有我在蘭德公司所做的工作，等等，這與那個時期非常相似。正如我之前提到的，我對哈佛商學院的研究非常感興趣，這在60年代肯定發展了起來，所以我對此非常感興趣。

--- 段落 295 (240 字元) ---
But it was sort of, I think, Jim, in particular, and Secretary of Defense Donald  Rumsfeld and some of the questions he posed about the Navy that led to further work on strategy.We wrote papers for Rumsfeld regarding the Navy and  strategy.

[翻譯]
但我認為，特別是吉姆和國防部長唐納德·拉姆斯菲爾德以及他對海軍提出的一些問題，推動了對戰略更進一步的研究。我們為拉姆斯菲爾德撰寫了關於海軍和戰略的論文。

--- 段落 296 (406 字元) ---
And then Jim and I, just because we wanted to do it, wrote this paper in  ‘76 [Strategy for Competing with the Soviets in the Military Sector of the Continuing  Political-Military Competition] on, OK, supposing the Pentagon wanted to have a  strategy, what would it look like?We wanted to make the case that the Defense  Department ought to really do things of that sort.And it sort of went on from  there.

[翻譯]
接著，Jim和我因為想做這件事情，於1976年寫了這篇文章[與蘇聯在政治軍事競爭中的軍事部門競爭戰略]，內容關於假設五角大廈想要制定一個策略，會是什麼樣子？我們想要證明國防部應該真正去做這樣的事情。從那裡開始，這種想法就不斷發展。

--- 段落 297 (313 字元) ---
- Q2: Well, in part, I think that’s because you’d had this notion that net assessment  was about diagnosis and not prescription.And so, you know, there was always  this… at least you said to me you were always concerned about people doing net  assessments also doing the strategy…  
- Marshall: Yeah [indistinct].

[翻譯]
Q2: 嗯，部分原因是因為你認為網絡評估是關於診斷而不是處方。所以，你知道，至少你告訴我你一直擔心做網絡評估的人也在制定戰略...
- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 298 (489 字元) ---
- Q2: …because you always cook the books on the net assessments to get to the preferred strategy, and so when it’s been…  
- Marshall: Well, not just strategy, but that they would have certain systems or…  
- Q2: Yeah, they’re pushing pet rocks…  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: …and things like that.So when from time to time it’s been posed that you  would also take over sort of Department strategy functions, you’ve been very  reluctant to do that.In fact, I think you refused to do it.

[翻譯]
問題2：因為你總是在網絡評估中虛報數據以達到偏好策略，所以當事情變得...

馬歇爾：嗯，不僅僅是策略，還有一些特定的系統或...

問題2：是的，他們正在推動寵物石...

馬歇爾：對，沒錯。 問題2：...以及類似這樣的事情。所以有時候提出讓你也接管部門策略功能，你非常不情願這樣做。事實上，我覺得你拒絕了這樣做。

--- 段落 299 (436 字元) ---
I mean you sort of backed  into a couple… on helping on competitive strategies or things like that, but really  not taking the lead.- Marshall: Well, we certainly pushed the idea that one ought to do this, and to do  experiments trying to spread the notion.- Q2: But not do them out of this office, with the same people doing the assessments  also doing the strategy.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: That’s a very good distinction to draw.

[翻譯]
我的意思是，在協助競爭策略或類似事情方面，你有一點點背後支持的感覺，但實際上並沒有帶領。- 馬歇爾：嗯，我們確實主張應該這樣做，並進行實驗以嘗試傳播這個概念。- Q2：但不是在這個辦公室進行這些實驗，評估也是由同一群人來做競爭策略。- 馬歇爾：是的，你說得對。這是一個非常好的區別。
