The election of George H.W.Bush was viewed by many as signaling an extension  of the national security policy of Ronald Reagan, under whom Bush served as vice  president.But Bush was immediately confronted with Chinese repression of civil  unrest, exemplified by the use of military force against civilians at Tiananmen Square  in June 1989.

[翻譯]
許多人認為，喬治·H·W·布什的當選象徵了羅納德·里根的國家安全政策的延續，布什在里根擔任副總統期間服務。但是，布什立即面臨中國對民眾抗議的鎮壓，例如1989年6月在天安門廣場使用軍事力量鎮壓民眾。

--- 段落 3 (323 字元) ---
In addition to condemning the response of the Chinese leadership,  the United States and the European Union imposed an embargo on arms sales to  China, and the subsequent growth of political and economic ties with China slowed.The United States faced a new problem when Saddam Hussein’s Iraq invaded  Kuwait in August 1990.

[翻譯]
除了譴責中國領導層的回應之外，美國和歐盟對中國實施了武器銷售禁運，後續與中國的政治和經濟聯繫增長放緩。1990年8月，薩達姆·侯賽因的伊拉克入侵科威特後，美國面臨了新的問題。

--- 段落 4 (480 字元) ---
Bush quickly assembled an international coalition of forces  to expel the Iraqi forces in Operation Desert Storm in 1991, but the first Gulf War led  to the years-long deployment of U.S.forces to the region.At the same time, Bush had to deal with the ongoing collapse of the Warsaw  Pact.Free elections were held in Hungary in March 1990, and in Czechoslovakia  in June.East and West Germany reunified in October 1990, and Lech Walesa was  elected president of Poland in December.

[翻譯]
布什在1991年迅速召集了一個國際聯盟力量，對伊拉克軍隊進行沙漠風暴行動，但第一次海灣戰爭導致美國軍隊多年部署在該地區。與此同時，布什不得不應對華沙條約組織的持續崩潰。匈牙利於1990年3月舉行了自由選舉，捷克斯洛伐克於6月進行了自由選舉。東西德於1990年10月統一，而萊赫·瓦文薩（Lech Walesa）於1990年12月當選波蘭總統。

The dissolution of the Soviet Union  continued, with the final transfer of power from Mikhail Gorbachev to Boris Yeltsin  in December 1991.Yeltsin busied himself with trying to shift to a free-enterprise  economy and a democratic government—both efforts were doomed to failure.The START I treaty with the Soviet Union, reducing strategic nuclear weapons, had  been signed in July 1991.

[翻譯]
蘇聯的解體持續進行，1991年12月，最終權力由米哈伊爾·戈爾巴喬夫轉移給鮑里斯·葉利欽。葉利欽忙於試圖轉型為自由企業經濟和民主政府，但這兩項努力注定失敗。《美蘇戰略武器削減條約》（START I）已於1991年7月與蘇聯簽署，旨在減少戰略核武器。

--- 段落 6 (463 字元) ---
It was followed shortly by Bush’s Presidential Nuclear  Initiative in September, which called for unilaterally withdrawing tactical nuclear  weapons from overseas American forces and U.S.Navy ships.Gorbachev, in one  of his last official acts, made a similar pledge of tactical nuclear force reductions in  the Soviet Armed Forces, a pledge Yeltsin reaffirmed when he came to power.William Clinton came to the Presidency with little experience in foreign affairs.

[翻譯]
不久之後，布什在九月提出了總統核倡議，呼籲從海外美國部隊和美國海軍艦艇單方面撤回戰術核武器。戈爾巴喬夫在他的最後一次官方行動中，做出了類似的承諾，承諾減少蘇聯軍隊的戰術核武力量，這是葉利欽掌權後重申的誓言。比爾·克林頓上任時對外交事務幾乎沒有經驗。

--- 段落 7 (292 字元) ---
He  inherited a humanitarian mission in Somalia from the Bush Administration that  quickly turned sour as American soldiers were dragged through the streets of  Mogadishu, the Somali capital.The resulting outcry from the American people led  to the resignation of Defense Secretary Les Aspin.

[翻譯]
他繼承了布什政府在索馬里的人道主義任務，但很快情況惡化，因為美國士兵在索馬里首都摩加迪沙被拉行街上。美國民眾對此的強烈抗議導致國防部長萊斯·阿斯平辭職。

--- 段落 8 (316 字元) ---
Clinton sought to promote a policy of “enlargement” designed to work through  international organizations as much as possible and avoid American unilateralism.Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic joined NATO and Russia was persuaded  to withdraw its forces from Estonia and Latvia.Despite his desire to avoid U.S.

[翻譯]
克林頓力求推動一項「擴張」政策，旨在通過國際組織盡可能工作，避免美國的單方面行動。波蘭、匈牙利和捷克共和國加入北約，俄羅斯也被說服從愛沙尼亞和拉脫維亞撤出其部隊。儘管他希望避免美國的单方面行動。

--- 段落 9 (442 字元) ---
unilateralism, in 1996 Clinton deployed two  aircraft carriers to the vicinity of Taiwan in response to the People’s Republic of  China’s attempt to intimidate Taiwan by shooting missiles into the waters around  the island.During Clinton’s presidency he was forced to spend a great deal of time addressing problems in the Balkans.The break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s created  six separate countries and produced regional instability.

[翻譯]
單邊主義，1996年，克林頓派遣兩艘航空母艦前往台灣附近，以回應中華人民共和國對台灣的威脅，即向島嶼周圍的水域發射導彈。在克林頓的總統任期內，他被迫花費大量時間解決巴爾幹半島的問題。南斯拉夫解體在1990年代初創造了六個獨立國家並導致該地區不穩定。

--- 段落 10 (318 字元) ---
Serbian atrocities against  Bosnian civilians eventually led to NATO bombing of Serb positions, a situation  that only escalated over the years until Clinton sent in 20,000 American troops  as part of a NATO deployment.A US-led operation in 1999—Operation Allied  Force—eventually brought relative peace to the region.

[翻譯]
塞爾維亞對波斯尼亞平民的暴行最終導致北約轟炸塞爾維亞的據點，這種情況在接下來的幾年只會升級，直到克林頓派遣了2萬名美軍參與北約部署。1999年美國領導的行動-聯合部隊行動，最終在該地區帶來了相對的和平。

## 1989–1993

[翻譯]
1989年至1993年

--- 段落 23 (414 字元) ---
- Marshall: Let me begin.The idea is to talk about the Bush and Clinton periods, and  talk mainly about the Bush period.The first thing is to say that the Bush period was very favorable for the office,  principally because of Paul Wolfowitz [Under Secretary of Defense for Policy].In  the first place, Wolfowitz was the first person to have that job who got to choose  his own deputies.And it really ran as a team.

[翻譯]
Marshall：讓我開始。這個想法是談論布什和克林頓時期，並主要談論布什時期。首先要說的是，布什時期非常有利於辦公室，主要是因為保羅·沃爾福維茨（國防政策副部長）。首先，沃爾福維茨是第一個擔任該職位的人，可以選擇自己的副手。而且他真的運作得像一支團隊一樣。

--- 段落 24 (413 字元) ---
Also, my own past association with  him, and everything, just made everything really work really very, very well.Indeed, when he was offered the thing, he called me up to ask whether he should  take the job.Well, he talked to Jim Roche and me, and, actually, I suppose, other  people.Jim and I had some meetings with him prior to him actually coming on  board to tell him what our view of the world was and so on.

[翻譯]
此外，我與他的過去關係，以及一切，確實讓一切非常順利。事實上，當他被提供這份工作時，他打電話給我詢問是否應該接受這份工作。他和吉姆·羅切（Jim Roche）以及其他人都有談過。在他正式加入團隊之前，吉姆和我與他進行了一些會議，告訴他我們對世界的看法等等。

--- 段落 25 (430 字元) ---
A lot of it came out of  the Future Security Environment stuff that had been finished shortly before that.3  And then, also, Paul had Roche prepare for him a plan for the organization and  function of the whole thing.Another thing that happened was this issue of what to do about the competitive  strategies effort.A group of people was put together to look at that.A proposal  was made that Daniel Gouré was to head the thing up.

[翻譯]
許多想法來自不久前完成的未來安全環境文件。另外，保羅還讓羅奇為他準備了一個組織和整個事務運作計劃。另一件事是有關競爭策略努力該怎麼辦的問題。一個小組被組成來討論此事。提案指定丹尼爾·古瑞擔任領導。

--- 段落 26 (465 字元) ---
Some good ideas were put  forward as to how it ought to be refocused, but it fundamentally failed, I think.I  didn’t pay enough attention to know exactly why, but it never quite made much  progress on some of the things that were proposed to it.- Q2: I think there were a couple of things involved.One was that I think Dan really  turned out not really to be the right guy for the thing.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: It’s not clear anybody could have done it at that time.

[翻譯]
一些好的想法被提出，可以重新聚焦在哪裡，但我認為它基本上是失敗了。我沒有付足夠的注意力去確切地知道為什麼，但它從未真正在一些被提出的事情上取得太多進展。Q2: 我認為有幾件事情牽涉其中。其中一個是我認為丹實際上並不是該事情的正確人選。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2: 在那個時候，不清楚任何人都能做到這一點。

--- 段落 27 (500 字元) ---
But Gouré is really a much  more policy-oriented kind of guy, than trying to think more long term.The other  thing is, at that point in time, it was very, very difficult, because you had the whole  transition with the Soviet Union, etc., and so, what did you do about all that, and  how did you change the competitive strategy initiative if your main competitor was  evolving or changing or maybe, as some said, going away.So Gouré had this sort of  competitive strategy portfolio with no competitor.

[翻譯]
但古雷實際上是一位更注重政策的人，而不是試圖更長遠地思考。另一件事是，在那個時候，情況非常非常困難，因為你必須應對與蘇聯的整個轉變，等等，那麼，你該怎麼樣處理這一切，以及當你的主要競爭對手正在發展或改變，或者也許，正如一些人所說的，正在消失時，你又該如何改變競爭策略。因此，古雷擁有這樣一種在沒有競爭對手的情況下的競爭策略組合。

--- 段落 28 (373 字元) ---
So there were these meetings…  
- Marshall: It took a long time to get agreement that, in fact, the thing would continue, and kind of a rump thing was kept in existence.- Q2: Right.And there were these sessions that eventually made the recommendation to Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney—  
- Marshall: Right, right.We had a session with Cheney.Q2: —to keep the thing going.

[翻譯]
於是有這些會議...
- 馬歇爾：花了很長時間才達成協議，事實上，這件事情將繼續下去，而一個殘餘的事情被保留了下來。
- Q2：是的。後來有這些會議，最後向國防部長迪克·切尼建議——
- 馬歇爾：對，對。我們和切尼開了一次會議。
- Q2：—保持這件事情繼續進行。

--- 段落 29 (401 字元) ---
But there was this off-line, ad hoc group, that I guess  you were the nominal co-chair of with Jim Roche, with Michael Duval…  
- Marshall: Yeah, Duval and Graham Allison.- Q2: And initially Lieutenant General [Air Force] Lee Butler came, but then he ended  up sending a brigadier in his place.- Marshall: Yeah.Q2: Butler was the J-5 [Director for Strategic Plans and Policy, Joint Staff] at the time.

[翻譯]
但有一個離線的臨時小組，我猜你是和吉姆·羅奇一起名義上的聯合主席，與邁克爾·杜瓦爾一起…  
- 馬歇爾：是的，杜瓦爾和葛雷厄姆·艾利森。- Q2：最初由空軍中將李巴特勒前來，但後來他派了一位準將代替。- 馬歇爾：是的。Q2：當時巴特勒是聯合參謀會戰略計劃和政策局（J-5）主任。

--- 段落 30 (345 字元) ---
And [William] Cockell was supposed to be involved in the thing, but he never  could quite make it out from the West Coast.- Marshall: Right.- Q2: But the notion was, “How do you change all this, or should you even keep it  going?” So the recommendation went to Cheney to keep it going.- Marshall: And to refocus it.- Q2: Refocus the effort, etc.

[翻譯]
柯克爾（William Cockell）本應參與此事，但他從西岸始終無法完全了解。- 馬歇爾（Marshall）：是的。- Q2：但核心問題是，“如何改變這一切，或者甚至是否應該繼續下去？”因此，建議交給切尼（Cheney）繼續下去。- 馬歇爾：並重新調整重點。- Q2：重新調整努力的方向，等等。

--- 段落 31 (224 字元) ---
But then, I think that nobody ever got a new focus that  was sufficiently compelling to keep the initiative going the way that it had been  when you had this real peer competitor out there like the Soviet Union to focus  on.

[翻譯]
但我認為沒有人得到一個足夠引人注目的新焦點，能像對抗蘇聯這樣的真正競爭對手那樣保持推動力。

--- 段落 32 (451 字元) ---
So, it got caught up in the circumstances, never really got a new raison d’être  that allowed it to keep going, although we did keep putting the words in the  National Security Strategy of the United States report,4 that the National Security  Council and the President put together, and then put it in the Defense Department annual report, and those kinds of things.But there really wasn’t much there.We couldn’t really figure out what to do with it.

[翻譯]
因此，它被困在環境中，從未真正找到新的使命，讓它繼續前進，儘管我們繼續將這些詞語放在美國國家安全戰略報告中，由國家安全委員會和總統共同制定，然後將其納入國防部的年度報告中，以及其他相關文件。但真的並沒有太多內容。我們並不能真正弄清楚該怎麼做。

--- 段落 33 (449 字元) ---
And then I think, eventually, it  devolved in this reconstitution thing.Being able to reconstitute our forces faster  than potential emerging competitors, which I think really wasn’t a very useful way  to think about it.The mobilization guys in the Department, seemed to me, got  their hands on it and it just kind of withered away into nothingness.- Marshall: Right.During the Bush years, we had an abortive effort to relook at the  Northern Flank.

[翻譯]
然後我認為，最後它變成了這種重新建立的事情。比潛在新興競爭對手更快地重建我們的力量，我認為這真的不是一個非常有用的思考方式。在部門裡的動員人員，我覺得他們掌握了這個問題，但最終又漸漸消失得無影無蹤。- 馬歇爾：沒錯。在布什政府期間，我們曾經對北方采取過重新審視的努力，但最終未能成功。

--- 段落 34 (445 字元) ---
We continued to do some looking at power projection.We did  a new assessment of Korea that I’ll come back to, the Robert Gaskin thing.Andy  Krepinevich replaced Jeff McKitrick, with the initial idea that he was going to  continue the Warsaw Pact thing, but within a year, there was a wrap-up effort that  was undertaken to understand what had happened to the balance as the result  of the change of status of the Soviet forces in Eastern Europe.

[翻譯]
我們繼續對力量投射進行研究。我們對韓國進行了新的評估，我會再回來談談羅伯特·加斯金的事情。安迪·克雷平夫奇接替傑夫·麥克特里克，最初的想法是繼續華沙條約組織的事務，但一年內，開展了一項總結工作，以了解由於蘇聯東歐部隊地位的改變對平衡產生了什麼影響。

--- 段落 35 (475 字元) ---
We also did work  related to the beginning of the more evident breaking up or coming down of the  Soviet Union, the Soviet Union “Chapter 11.” And then there was the start-up of  this effort on the MTR [military-technical revolution], which began probably in  mid-‘89, I would think.The first thing to talk a little bit about is this Soviet Union Chapter 11.The main  pitch I made to Paul Wolfowitz, even before he took over, was, “Look, the Soviet  Union is in real trouble.

[翻譯]
我們也進行了與蘇聯解體或崩解關係更加明顯的開始相關的工作，蘇聯的「第 11 章」。然後，在 MTR（軍事技術革命）的啟動工作開始了，這可能是在 1989 年中期，我想。首先要談談的是蘇聯的第 11 章。我向保羅·沃爾福維茨提出的主要觀點，甚至在他接任之前，是：“看，蘇聯真的處於困境中。

--- 段落 36 (410 字元) ---
” I used to use chess analogues of …  
- Q3: Middle game [indistinct].- Marshall: Yeah.“We’ve emerged from the middle game with a won game.Now  the big thing is not to screw it up, but really be astute.That’s the frame of mind  people ought to be in.And it’s not only that we have a [indistinct] won game,  we have a tremendous advantage.” This view was based on my feeling that most  of the people in the U.S.

[翻譯]
我曾經使用象棋的類比...  
- Q3：中場遊戲[不明確]。- 馬歇爾：是的。“我們已經從中場遊戲中贏得了比賽。現在最重要的不是搞砸，而是真正聰明一些。人們應該擁有這樣的心態。而且不僅我們贏得了比賽，我們還佔據了極大的優勢。”這個觀點來自於我認為美國大部分人的想法。

--- 段落 37 (343 字元) ---
government didn’t understand that and, secondly, that  the nature of the changes likely to be taking place, although they all happened  much more rapidly than I ever expected at that time, was such that you shouldn’t count on President Mikhail Gorbachev being there or any of the people that you  were talking with or dealing with being there.

[翻譯]
政府並不了解這一點，其次，即使所有變化發生得比我當時預期的都要快得多，這些變化的性質也使你不應該指望米哈伊爾·戈爾巴喬夫總統或你正在交談或打交道的任何人依然留在那裡。

--- 段落 38 (388 字元) ---
And I probably kept going back to  things that I was saying in the middle ‘80s to Dennis Ross, that you ought to think  of yourself as talking to Louis XVI’s ministers, and that relationships you might develop might not last too long, because they might not be there too much longer.I don’t know that any of that had too much effect, but I think Paul was convinced  and took it seriously.

[翻譯]
我可能一直回想起我在80年代中期對丹尼斯·羅斯說過的話，你應該將自己視為在與路易十六的大臣對話，你建立的關係可能不會持續太久，因為他們可能不會再待太久。我不知道這些話是否有太大的影響，但我認為保羅被說服了並且認真對待這件事。

--- 段落 39 (499 字元) ---
Of the things that were done during the Bush period, in terms of assessments, I’d  say only two, maybe the beginning of the third thing… But one was the Korean  case that we looked at.And the second was the stuff that ended up with the first  MTR assessment in July of ‘92.So let me talk about the Korean thing…I guess the  other thing we were looking at was how proliferation would change the character  of the power projection problem, and we did do some things, gaming and so on  concerning that.

[翻譯]
在布什時期所做的事情中，就評估而言，我會說只有兩個，也許是第三個事情的開始... 但其中一個是我們研究的韓國案例。第二個是導致1992年7月第一次MTR評估的事情。讓我來談談韓國的事情...我想我們正在觀察的另一個事情是擴散如何改變權力投射問題的性質，我們確實在進行了一些遊戲和其他活動來討論這個問題。

--- 段落 40 (499 字元) ---
But the two big things, I guess, were the Korean assessment and  the MTR thing.The Korean thing really came about because Gaskin— It was appropriate to  pick it up because, again, we had this pattern of after people either not watching closely enough or finally they were looking closely all the time, but it finally  became clear to them that the North Koreans had gone through a whole new  period of investment and change, and that significant improvements had taken  place in their force posture.

[翻譯]
但我想最重要的兩件事是韓國的評估和地鐵事宜。韓國的事情確實是因為蓋斯金而出現的。選擇介入是合適的，因為我們又一次看到一個模式，人們在某人沒有仔細觀察時，或者他們最終一直在仔細觀察，但最終他們清楚地看到北韓已經經歷了一個全新的投資和變革時期，並且他們的軍事姿態發生了顯著的改善。

--- 段落 41 (346 字元) ---
- Q2: Did this come out of a National Intelligence Estimate or something?- Marshall: No, it was some work by some guys in the Defense Intelligence Agency,  fundamentally.And we came to know about that, and Gaskin, who had served, I  guess, a couple of times in Korea, was very interested, and so volunteered to pick  up that and do an assessment.

[翻譯]
問2：這是從國家情報評估中得出的嗎？- 馬歇爾：不是，這是國防情報局的一些人的工作。我們得知了這個情況，蓋斯金曾在韓國服役了幾次，對此非常感興趣，因此自願進行評估。

--- 段落 42 (394 字元) ---
The assessment, I thought, always had far too much this character of an inspector  general’s report, rather than a real assessment, because it was heavy on the problems on our side.I kept pushing Gaskin about, “What are their problems?” and  to get it more even-balanced, but was never fully successful.He always had the  excuse, “Well, we don’t know enough about them and some of their things.

[翻譯]
我認為評估總是具有稽查總監報告的特徵過多，而非真正的評估，因為它過於著重我們這一方的問題。我一直在敦促加斯金問：「他們有什麼問題？」並讓評估更加平衡，但從未完全成功。他總是找藉口說：「我們對他們和一些事情了解不夠。"

--- 段落 43 (385 字元) ---
” That’s  true in a way, but nonetheless, it had this fairly aggressive inspector general-like  aspect to much of it, which I got toned down as much as I could.Maybe I could  have persevered and got it toned down still further.But I thought that he did turn  up some really interesting stuff.Now, the assessment was extremely unwelcomed.- Q8: You’re thinking of Carl Ford [indistinct].

[翻譯]
這在某種程度上是真的，但無論如何，它有相當具有監察總監的那種侵略性，我試著盡量減少這種感覺。也許我本可以堅持下去，使它更加溫和。但我覺得他確實發現了一些非常有趣的東西。現在，這個評估是極不受歡迎的。- Q8：您在想卡爾·福特 [不清楚]。

--- 段落 44 (203 字元) ---
- Marshall: Carl Ford [Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs], well…  
- Q8: Who had worked on this project while he was in earlier jobs.He was a stakeholder.

[翻譯]
Marshall: 卡爾·福特[美國國防部國際安全事務副助理部長]，嗯...
Q8: 他在早前的工作中已經參與過這個項目。他是利害關係人。

--- 段落 45 (301 字元) ---
- Marshall: There’s that, but also he was a stakeholder for a different reason in that in  the early part of the Bush Administration, there was some pressure on Capitol Hill to withdraw more troops from Korea, and a big defense had been put up by the  Administration about why that wasn’t a good idea.

馬歇爾說道：除此之外，他也因為在布什政府早期，國會山有一些壓力要從韓國撤出更多軍隊，政府對此提出了堅決的防禦立場，認為這不是一個好主意。

And there also was this overall  strategy that was supposed to be developed for Asia, and it was very awkward to  have an assessment whose major message was that the South Koreans really  weren’t trying very hard.5 On the one hand, there were these new developments  that the North had gone through—the repositioning of the forces, the great  increase in artillery, and a number of other things—to which the South had not  really responded.

[翻譯]
同時，還應該為亞洲制定一個全面的戰略，但遇到一個很尷尬的評估，其主要訊息是韓國人並沒有真的很努力。一方面，北方經歷了一些新的發展－調整軍隊的部署、大幅增加火炮等等，而南方並沒有真正做出回應。

--- 段落 47 (438 字元) ---
Instead, the South was off starting to build a submarine fleet  and other naval things to deal with its real and future enemy, the Japanese, or  whoever else in the region they were focused on.And so, the assessment was  very unwelcome.It was not entirely suppressed, but it had very limited distribution.It went to the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Robert RisCassi, who was about  to go out and take command of U.S.

[翻譯]
相反地，南方開始建造潛艇艦隊和其他海軍裝備，以應對真正的和未來的敵人，日本，或者他們在該地區專注的其他敵人。因此，這個評估是非常不受歡迎的。它並沒有完全被壓制，但分發地很有限。它發送給聯合參謀長主席和即將出任美國指揮的羅伯特·里斯卡西將軍。

--- 段落 48 (487 字元) ---
forces in Korea, got a copy and read it, and  talked with both Gaskin and myself, and he took it very seriously.And it had an  impact, both in terms of, I think, some things that RisCassi did when he was out  there, and also certainly his request for a relook at the whole plan and so on, and  some modifications were made in the war plans to beef up the forces and so on.When it was sent out, I put a memo on top of it which pointed out what I thought  was the main import of the thing.

[翻譯]
在韓國的部隊之間的合作，獲得了一份副本並閱讀了其中的內容，並與加斯金和我進行了交談，他對此非常重視。這次的事件產生了影響，我認為在里斯卡西出去時做了一些事情，另外他對整個計劃的要求進行重新檢查等，對戰爭計劃做了一些修改以加強部隊等等。當它被發送出去時，我在其頂部放上了一份備忘錄，指出了我認為這件事情的主要影響。

--- 段落 49 (323 字元) ---
In the first place, this thing just dealt with the  conventional kind of attack, and I guess the first thing I mentioned was that  these people may have, somewhere along the line, nuclear weapons and that’s  something we need to be thinking about, and so the thing is not the whole story  about what the situation is there.

[翻譯]
首先，這個問題只是處理傳統類型的攻擊，而我想我提到的第一件事是，這些人可能在某個時候擁有核武器，這是我們需要思考的事情，所以這件事並不能完全說明當地的情況。

--- 段落 50 (360 字元) ---
Secondly, I wrote that I found the story of the  South’s limited response to what the North was doing, and indeed the whole  orientation of their efforts, to suggest that the South was, in fact, much like our  other feckless allies, relying on us to deter the opponent, while they didn’t do the  things they ought to do to fully play their role and their part.

[翻譯]
其次，我寫道，我發現南方對北方所做之事的有限反應，以及他們整個努力的取向，都暗示著南方其實與我們其他毫無作為的盟友很相似，依賴我們來威懾對手，而他們卻沒有做應該做的事情來完全履行他們的角色和責任。

--- 段落 51 (409 字元) ---
I said that this was  not a novel problem, because we’d been through that in Europe and the outcome  had been OK, but it was a dangerous game.Therefore, in the current situation, on  the one hand, we ought to be talking to the South and trying to motivate them  to do what they should do to deal with the threat.On the other hand, we should  be focusing a lot on the issue of how we, in fact, deter the North.

[翻譯]
我說這不是一個新問題，因為我們在歐洲已經歷過這種情況，結果還算不錯，但這是一場危險的遊戲。因此，在目前這種情況下，一方面，我們應該與南方進行對話，嘗試激勵他們做應對威脅的事情。另一方面，我們應該著重於如何實際上威懾北方的問題。

--- 段落 52 (352 字元) ---
And that’s not  so much a matter of bringing in necessarily additional ground forces or so on, but  what threats are important, how do we influence their calculations sorts of thing.They don’t do it, because in the longer run, the whole game is running against  them for economic and other reasons.My belief is that nothing at this level ever happened.

[翻譯]
這並不是一定要增加地面部隊之類的問題，而是關於哪些威脅比較重要，我們如何影響他們的思考方式。他們不這樣做，是因為從長遠來看，整個遊戲在經濟和其他原因上對他們不利。我認為這個層面上絕對沒有發生過這樣的事情。

--- 段落 53 (349 字元) ---
I don’t know that there was  any effort to really seriously deal with the South and say, “What the hell are you  doing spending your money the way you’re doing?” I’m not sure that we did things  to increase deterrence, although I did have a long discussion with Wolfowitz  about that, because there were some things that I’d known about in the past.

[翻譯]
我不知道是否有任何努力真正認真地處理南方並說，“你到底在做什麼，花你的錢方式？”我不確定我們是否做了任何增加威懾力的事情，雖然我曾與沃爾福維茲進行過一次長時間討論，因為過去我知道一些事情。

--- 段落 54 (495 字元) ---
In  the late ‘70s or so [Jul 1979], I remember General John Wickham, who was then  commander out there, had talked to me about, when I visited him—the only time  I’ve ever been in Korea—about various actions that were being taken to impress  on the North the capabilities that we might employ and so on, possibilities of deception, a whole bunch of other things that could be used, and that people  ought to be being imaginative about that.But I have no idea whether anything  ever came of that.

[翻譯]
在70年代後期左右[1979年7月]，我記得當時的指揮官約翰·威克漢將軍，當時他與我談到，在我造訪他時（這是我唯一一次去過韓國），有關於採取的各種行動來向北方展示我們可能會使用的能力，以及可能的欺騙手段、其他可以使用的事情等等，並且人們應該對此展開想像。但我不知道這些有關於這些的事情是否有任何進展。

--- 段落 55 (493 字元) ---
- Q3: These discussions were Wickham’s…had some things to do with the presence  of B-52s over Korea at the time of the tree-cutting incident [Aug 1976]?6  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: And his observations about North Korean reactions to that?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: RisCassi says that one of the first things he did when he got over there was he  asked to see the war plan.And he took a look at the war plan and he said, “This is  great, it doesn’t say anything about how we’re going to win the war.

[翻譯]
問題3：這些討論是關於…在樵夫事件（1976年8月）當時B-52轟炸機出現在朝鮮的一些事情嗎？
馬歇爾：是的。
問題3：他對北韓對這件事的反應有什麼看法？
馬歇爾：是的。
問題2：RisCassi說，當他到那裡後，第一件事就是要求看戰爭計劃。他看了一下戰爭計劃，然後說，“這太好了，完全沒說我們該怎樣贏得這場戰爭。

--- 段落 56 (490 字元) ---
” And so he  told his war planners to go back and construct a war plan in which the political-military objective was not just for the restoration of the status quo ante (even  that was not made an explicit objective in the existing plans), but was, in fact, reunification of the Korean peninsula.7 And he said it was interesting, because when  they did that and rewrote the war plan, it came out to be a totally different kind  of war plan than the kind that he had when he walked in there.

[翻譯]
因此，他告訴他的戰爭策劃者要重新制定戰爭計劃，其中政治軍事目標不僅僅是恢復前狀（甚至現有計劃中也沒有明確設定這一目標），而是實際上是朝鮮半島的統一。他說，這很有趣，因為當他們這樣做並重寫了戰爭計劃時，它變成了一個完全不同類型的戰爭計劃，與他一開始持有的那種計劃完全不同。

--- 段落 57 (464 字元) ---
He told me this  as he left being Commander in Chief, ROK/U.S.Combined Forces Command, but I  don’t know if you had any discussions with him as to the nature of the changes he  made in his war plans over there or how that might have related to this.- Marshall: No.I heard a little bit about that.I did have lunch with him when he was  retired, in fact, about a year ago or so, when all of this thing flared up again, got  leaked by Gaskin, among others, I suppose.

[翻譯]
當他卸任韓美聯合部隊司令官時，他告訴我這個消息，但我不知道你是否與他討論過他在戰爭計畫上所做的變動，或者這可能與這件事有關。- 馬修爾：不，我聽說了一點。事實上，大約一年前，當所有這些事情再次被加斯金等人洩漏時，我和他一起吃了午餐，他已經退休了。

--- 段落 58 (458 字元) ---
8 I wanted to talk with him just to ask  him how he felt about what the real state of the situation was, because one of the  other things, you see, that came out clearly was our limited intelligence about the  North, and the whole issue really in the end came…well, anyway, one thing that  would be very important would be, “How well do you think these guys are really  going to fight?” And—  
- Q2: Actually, that was a question about both sides, wasn’t it?

[翻譯]
我想和他談談，只是想問問他對情況的真實狀況感覺如何，因為另一個明顯的問題是我們對北方的情報有限，最終問題的關鍵是... 嗯，不管怎樣，非常重要的一點是，“你認為這些人真的會打得多好？”- Q2：實際上，這是關於雙方的問題，不是嗎？

--- 段落 59 (467 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, but you see, you had a lot of this evidence that maybe the South  wasn’t going to do very well.On the other hand, what are you going to assume  about the North?Are they going to be very effective?If you’re dealing with the  equipment of the panzer divisions, you’re in a hell of a lot of trouble.And on the  other hand, if you’re dealing with…[gap for tape change] …skills and so on, that’s  another thing.So I wanted to talk to RisCassi about that.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，但你看，你有許多證據表明南方可能表現得並不好。另一方面，對北方，你會做出什麼假設？他們會表現得非常有效嗎？如果你在處理裝甲師的裝備，你就會有很大的麻煩。另一方面，如果你在處理…[為更換錄音帶留白]…技能等等，那又是另一回事。所以我想與RisCassi討論這件事。

--- 段落 60 (488 字元) ---
One of the things we did after the assessment was done was we met with people  in the intelligence community, both from CIA and the National Security Agency,  to see what could be done to try to increase our information about the North.And it really all came down to the ground forces and the special operations  forces.The air force, it’s clear, is terrible.They don’t fly very much and so on.It  really comes down to, “What’s the operational effectiveness of the North’s ground  forces?

[翻譯]
評估完成後，我們做的事情之一是與情報界的人士會面，包括來自中央情報局和國家安全局，看看能夠做些什麼來增加我們對北方情報的了解。這真的主要涉及陸軍和特種作戰部隊。空軍很顯然表現糟糕，他們飛行時間不多等等。總結來說，問題其實是“北方陸軍的作戰效力如何？”

--- 段落 61 (341 字元) ---
” And, in fact, I don’t think that that’s an impossible task, to say something  about the existing bases, which really were limited.I don’t think things have gotten any better.I haven’t looked at it, but I don’t think so.Part of my reason  for having lunch with RisCassi was to just get his judgment about what he really  thought about that.

[翻譯]
而且，事實上，我不認為這是一個不可能的任務，對現有基礎做出一些評論，這些基礎確實是有限的。我不認為情況有變得更好。我沒有看過，但我不認為如此。我和RisCassi共餐的部分原因是為了聽聽他對此真正想法。

--- 段落 62 (384 字元) ---
- Q2: I know one of the other things that RisCassi did while he was over there was he  had this massive improvement effort, which really became a model for most of  the theater commanders, on a C4I [command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence] architecture, because he was convinced that he was going  to have to do all this on the move, on the run, from the get-go.

[翻譯]
Q2：我知道RisCassi在那裡的另一個工作是，他進行了巨大的改進努力，這實際上成為大部分戰區指揮官的模範，談到C4I架構（指揮、控制、通信、計算機和情報），因為他深信他將必須隨時隨地在運動中完成所有這些工作。

--- 段落 63 (220 字元) ---
He was going to  have to flow the force from CONUS [Eds: the continental United States] that he  needed to fight and win the war over there, at the same time that he was fighting  and trying not to lose a war over there.

[翻譯]
他必須將所需的力量從美國本土轉移到那裡，以便在那裡打贏戰爭，同時又在那裡與敵人對抗，努力不輸掉另一場戰爭。

--- 段落 64 (419 字元) ---
So he developed a seamless architecture  from CONUS to Korea that allowed him to fight on the move, because he really  didn’t feel that the in-place forces he had over there were going to be sufficient  and adequate to actually win the war and achieve these new wartime objectives  of the reunification of Korea.- Marshall: Right.And I think some changes were made in the pace of reinforcement,  or they hoped for that.

[翻譯]
所以他發展了一個從美國本土到韓國的無縫建築，讓他能夠在移動中作戰，因為他真的覺得那裡的現有部隊不足以真正贏得戰爭，實現朝鮮半島的統一這些新的戰時目標。- 馬歇爾：對。我認為在援軍速度上進行了一些改變，或者他們希望如此。

--- 段落 65 (489 字元) ---
So at any rate, that’s one of the—  
- Q2: It may be one of the few instances, actually, or at least one of the few identifiable instances, where one of your assessments directly affected—  
- Marshall: Right.- Q2: —a CINC [theater commander in chief] OPLAN [operation plan], force structure,  key elements of the force structure, reinforcement plan, etc.I don’t know of any  other case—  
- Marshall: No…  
- Q2: —with the possible exception of the stuff you did on antisubmarine warfare.

[翻譯]
所以無論如何，這是其中一個例子 - Q2: 實際上可能是少數幾個例子之一，或者至少是少數可識別例子之一，其中你的評估直接影響到 - Marshall: 對 - Q2: - 一個 CINC（指揮官）OPLAN （作戰計劃），部隊結構，部隊結構的重要元素，增援計劃等。我不知道有任何其他案例 - Marshall: 不… - Q2: - 除了你在反潛作戰上所做的工作可能是個例外。

--- 段落 66 (249 字元) ---
- Marshall: Right.- Q2: But that wasn’t really a theater campaign plan.That was a smaller-scale thing.- Marshall: Right.- Q2: So this may be one of the few cases where there was a direct effect on a CINC  OPLAN and force structure.- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：是的。
Q2：但那並不是真正的一個戰略規劃，那只是小規模的事情。
馬歇爾：對。
Q2：所以這可能是少數幾個案例之一，直接影響了統帥（CINC）的作戰計劃（OPLAN）和部隊結構。
馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 67 (396 字元) ---
Before we go to the MTR thing, one of the things that happened in the wrapping  up of the NATO-Warsaw Pact effort was that where the initial effort was to just  look at what had happened as a result of the withdrawals, or what would be the  case when the Soviet forces had withdrawn from Eastern Europe and the reductions had taken place and so on, we also wanted to look at future contingencies.

[翻譯]
在我們討論地鐵事情之前，北約-華沙條約整頓工作中發生的一件事是，最初的目標僅是查看蘇聯軍隊從東歐撤軍後，或是縮減發生後的情況，我們也想要探討未來可能發生的緊急情況。

--- 段落 68 (442 字元) ---
That led to a major investment at BDM in modeling, which also was an effort to…  because you wanted to look at a different kind of engagement, in effect, a large  meeting engagement in the middle of Poland.And it also was, if you looked into  the future, to look at the role of reconnaissance-strike complexlike systems, longrange systems that would begin engaging targets before the forces themselves  actually got very close to one another.

[翻譯]
這導致了BDM在建模方面的重大投資，這也是一項努力…因為您想要觀察一種不同類型的參與，實際上是在波蘭中部的大型會晤中。而且，如果您展望未來，這也是為了研究偵察-打擊複雜系統的角色，這些長程系統將在部隊實際相遇之前就開始攻擊目標。

--- 段落 69 (424 字元) ---
And, in fact, we knew from the Russian writings that they had talked about this new phase in the engagement of…what  did they call it?“Range fires,” I guess.- Q2: “Range fires”?- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: Talking about “maneuvering fires”?- Marshall: No.I mean just this whole notion that as the forces closed, they would  become engaged through these longer-range fires, and attrition would begin  before the forces came to meet.

[翻譯]
事實上，我們從俄羅斯的著作中知道，他們提到了在這種“範圍火”參與的新階段。- Q2: “範圍火”？- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2: 說的是“機動火”？- 馬歇爾：不是。我的意思是，當部隊接近時，他們將通過這些更遠程的火力而參與，而消耗戰將在部隊相遇之前開始。

--- 段落 70 (344 字元) ---
So instead of the forces starting up against one  another, now you had to take account of this fact that…  
- Q2: Long-range fires could engage and attrit before the ground forces even engaged.- Marshall: Yeah, before they engaged.So this was one phase.Then there was the  actual meeting engagement, and then the close engagement of the forces.

[翻譯]
因此，現在不是各方之間開始對抗，而是必須考慮這個事實...  
- Q2: 遠程武器可以在地面部隊交戰之前就開始進行交火和削弱對方實力。- 馬歇爾：是的，在他們交戰之前。所以這是其中一個階段。然後是真正的相遇交戰，然後是部隊的近距離交戰。

--- 段落 71 (367 字元) ---
- Q2: In fact, your meeting engagement in the middle of Poland ended up being a  Defense Planning Guidance scenario and a kind of a cause célèbre in The New York  Times, didn’t it?Remember when that DPG scenario leaked [Patrick Tyler], as it always  does, and this thing about this battle in the middle of Poland was a big issue.9  
- Marshall: Could have been.Right.

[翻譯]
Q2：事實上，你在波蘭中部參加的會議最終變成了一個防衛計畫指導情境，也成為了紐約時報的熱門話題，對吧？還記得那個防衛計畫指導情境被洩漏的時候（帕特里克·泰勒），就像總是會發生的一樣，而在波蘭中部這場戰役成為了一個重大問題。
- 馬歇爾：有可能。就是這樣。

--- 段落 72 (439 字元) ---
Also, the attempt was made, I think for the first  time, to build in to this model some of the information aspects of this engagement.Because if you’re going to have these long-range fires, one of the things  that needs to be reflected is the degree to which one side or the other would be  better at that, of finding targets, and also of knowing where the other forces really  were as the meeting engagement came about.- Q2: Who did that?

[翻譯]
同時，我認為這是第一次嘗試在這個模型中加入一些有關這種衝突的資訊層面。因為如果要使用這些遠程火力，必須要反映出一方或另一方在尋找目標方面的能力，以及在會戰發生時對對方的位置了解程度。- 問題2：是誰做了這個工作？

--- 段落 73 (409 字元) ---
- Marshall: That was built into the thing, and I think we played several…  
- Q2: Built into BDM’s [model]?- Marshall: Yes, right.And, in fact, we got the SOLIC [special operations and low-intensity conflict] people involved, because one of the ways in which information  might be obtained was not through sensor systems, but that [special operations].So anyway, that was one of the good things that happened.

[翻譯]
- Marshall: 那是內置在那件事情中的，我認為我們進行了數次…
- Q2: 內置在BDM的[模型]中嗎？- Marshall: 對，沒錯。事實上，我們讓SOLIC [特種作戰和低強度衝突]的人參與其中，因為獲得信息的一種方式不是通過感應器系統，而是通過那種 [特種作戰] 。總之，那是發生的好事情之一。

--- 段落 74 (416 字元) ---
I started to talk with Krepinevich about the MTR, again, coming out of the middle  ‘80s stuff on the future security environment [for the Commission on Integrated  Long-Term Strategy].So he began to look at that, as I said, probably in mid-‘89 or  certainly by early ‘90, and put out the assessment in ‘92.From the beginning, I made a decision that we were going to do that assessment  in a very, very different way.

[翻譯]
我再次開始和克雷皮涅維奇談論關於未來安全環境的MTR（多年趨勢評估），這個話題來自於1980年代中期在整合長期戰略委員會的研究。所以他開始研究這個議題，如我所說，可能是在1989年中期或者至少在1990年初，並於1992年出版評估結果。從一開始，我就做出了決定，我們將以非常不同的方式進行這次評估。

--- 段落 75 (445 字元) ---
The usual thing had been that the assessments were  done really in-house, just by people in this office and with inputs from the outside  of various sorts.But because it seemed to me that if you really thought of this  as the beginning of a period of major change, like the early ‘20s, we ought to  conduct this thing in a way that tended to co-opt people, and we would be in the  process of generating a vocabulary that we wanted to be adopted.

[翻譯]
過去的做法通常是評估完全在內部進行，只由辦公室的人員負責，並從外部輸入各種資料。但是因為我覺得如果真的把這看作是一個重要改變時期的開始，就像二十世紀二十年代初期一樣，我們應該採取一種更加讓人樂意參與的方式進行這件事情，並且我們將會在這個過程中創造一套我們希望被採用的詞彙。

--- 段落 76 (476 字元) ---
And so, totally  differently than we’d done any other assessments, it was done through a series of panels.So people were addressing various topic areas and so on, such as, “What  are the technologies which you think are going to be important?How might  warfare change?Here are the Russian ideas, what ideas do people have?” So it  was conducted, as I say, in a very, very different way.- Q2: What was your plan for the allies?- Marshall: I didn’t have any plan for the allies.

[翻譯]
因此，與我們進行其他評估時完全不同，這是通過一系列小組討論進行的。人們討論各種主題，例如，“你認為哪些技術將是重要的？戰爭可能會如何改變？這是俄羅斯的想法，人們有什麼想法？”所以，正如我所說的，這是以非常非常不同的方式進行的。- 問題2：你對盟友有什麼計劃嗎？- 馬歇爾：我沒有為盟友制定任何計劃。

--- 段落 77 (462 字元) ---
The critical questions really were,  “Do you really feel that we’re in one of these periods where there will be major  changes?” In other words, are the Russians right when they say that we’re in this  new period of a military-technical revolution?Then, “Why has it happened?” What  are the technologies or other things that will lead to changes?Are we at the  beginning, middle, or end of this process?Is the thing mostly over, or are we at  the very beginning?

[翻譯]
關鍵問題實際上是：“您是否真的覺得我們正處於一個將會發生重大變革的時期？”換句話說，俄羅斯人所說的我們正處於一個軍事技術革命的新時期，這話說得對嗎？接著，“為什麼會發生這種情況？”是什麼技術或其他因素將會帶來變化？我們是在這過程的開始、中間還是末端？這件事大部分過去了，還是我們才剛剛開始？

--- 段落 78 (361 字元) ---
So we posed those questions, and a number of others which  we didn’t answer very well, like, “Who else is going to be involved in this?What  should our strategy be?” Various things of that sort.And one of the purposes of  going for these kind of panel discussions was to get a sense of how widely shared  was some judgment that, in fact, we’re in such a period.

[翻譯]
因此，我們提出了這些問題，以及其他一些我們沒有回答得很好的問題，比如“還會有誰參與其中？我們應該採取什麼策略？”諸如此類的各種事情。參加這些座談會的目的之一是為了瞭解有多少人認為，實際上我們正處於這樣一個時期。

--- 段落 79 (347 字元) ---
Because if that were so,  then in some sense, the main issue would be, “How do you make people take seriously what it is you ought to do if you really are in such a period?” And my feeling  now is that those people tend to sign up to the fact that you’re in such a period,  but then don’t draw very striking conclusions as to what you ought to do.

[翻譯]
因為如果是這樣的話，那在某種程度上，主要問題將是，“如果你真的處於這樣的時期，你應該如何讓人們認真對待你應該做的事情？”而我現在的感覺是，這些人傾向於認同你處於這樣的時期，但是卻沒有對你應該做什麼得出非常明顯的結論。

--- 段落 80 (313 字元) ---
But as  to the allies, that matter emerged as we got around to really writing the assessment, and when we came to the issues, it was really one of the four major issues  that we surfaced for people to really start thinking about, which hasn’t happened,  at least on that.So…  
- Q2: Who does the assessment go to?

[翻譯]
但關於盟友，這個問題在我們真正開始寫評估時浮現出來，當我們開始討論問題時，這確實是我們提出的四大主要問題之一，讓人們開始思考，至少目前還沒有發生過。因此...
- 問題二：評估報告要送給誰？

--- 段落 81 (263 字元) ---
- Marshall: The assessment initially went to people like Wolfowitz, to the heads of the  Services… One of the things, again, that was striking to me was that I expected  that we would have a lot of resistance and flak, but we didn’t actually encounter  that much.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：最初評估的一開始是交給像沃爾夫威茨（Wolfowitz）這樣的人，還有各服務部門的領導人… 其中一件讓我印象深刻的事情是，我原本期待會遇到很多阻力和反彈，但實際上我們並沒有遇到太多。

--- 段落 82 (410 字元) ---
I was surprised at the degree to which people tended to agree that  we were probably in such a period, but since implicitly you would be threatening  platforms that people currently love and other things, I thought we would have a  lot more overt resistance—I’m sure that we have lots of foot-dragging and other  things.The other thing that struck me was that the top-level people often were quite  supportive.

[翻譯]
我對人們普遍同意我們可能正處於這樣一段時期感到驚訝，但因為潛在地你可能會威脅到人們目前喜愛的平台和其他事物，我認為我們本應更多地面對抵制-我相信我們有很多拖延和其他事情。另一件讓我感到印象深刻的事情是，高層人員通常相當支持。

--- 段落 83 (463 字元) ---
Indeed General Gordon Sullivan [Army Vice Chief of Staff at the time]  had somebody call down and asked to see me.My guess is that that probably  would have been, say, the summer of ‘91.And, in fact, his office and the people  who support him didn’t ever seem to get it through their minds that it was that  he wanted to see me, because they kept calling down here about what it was that  I wanted to talk to him about.And all I knew was that he wanted to see me.

[翻譯]
事實上，當時陸軍副參謀長沙利文將軍有人打電話過來，要求見我。我猜那可能是在1991年的夏天。事實上，他的辦公室和支持他的人似乎從來沒有明白他想見我，因為他們一直打電話來詢問我要和他談什麼。我只知道他想見我。

--- 段落 84 (424 字元) ---
They  wanted to know, was there a read-ahead?Was there this, was there that so they  could prepare him.So I went there, and he by that time knew that we were working on the MTR assessment, I guess because the Army guys had been involved in  a number of these panels that we were running.What he had to say to me was  that he was very supportive, and, in fact, asked, “What could the Army do?How could he help me?” and so on.

[翻譯]
他們想知道，有沒有提前準備？有沒有這個，有沒有那個，這樣他們可以準備。所以我去了那裡，他那時已經知道我們正在進行MTR評估，我想是因為陸軍的人參與了我們運營的許多這樣的小組。他對我說的是他非常支持，實際上還問：“軍隊能做什麼？他怎樣幫助我？”等等。

--- 段落 85 (425 字元) ---
And then a little later—probably in very late ‘91  or early ‘92—General Merrill McPeak [Air Force Chief of Staff] called up, made an  appointment, and came to see me in my office.He’s the only Chief of Staff who’s  ever done that.He said he wanted to be the point of contact in the Air Force for  whatever it was I was doing, and that he was very supportive and so on.So I’d been  struck by the support from top-level people.

[翻譯]
然後稍晚一點 - 大概是在1991年末或1992年初 - 美國空軍參謀長梅里爾·麥克皮克將軍打電話給我，預約會面，來到我的辦公室。他是唯一一位這樣做過的參謀長。他說他想成為空軍中我所從事活動的聯絡點，並且表示他非常支持我等等。所以我對來自高層人士的支持印象深刻。

Or somebody like Rear Admiral William  Owens [later promoted to four star and appointed Vice Chairman of the JCS]—he  was Cheney’s military assistant—was always very supportive all along and helpful.So at the very top level you had an amazing and favorable kind of response.- Q2: Then again, recall Sullivan’s comments about, “We’re downsizing too fast.”  
- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: “We got all these Serb hordes.We’re kicking people out of the Army left and right.You don’t know who the threat is.

[翻譯]
或者像威廉·歐文斯後來被提拔為四星上將並被任命為聯合參謀會副主席那樣的人，他是切尼的軍事助理，一直非常支持和有幫助。所以在最高層面上，您得到了令人驚訝和有利的回應。- Q2: 再說一下，記得蘇利文對“我們縮減得太快”這一點的評論。- 馬歇爾: 是的。- Q2: 「我們這裡有這麼多塞爾維亞人，我們正在左右踢出軍隊的人。你不知道威脅來自哪裡。

I can’t really ask the Army to get engaged in  an RMA right now because it will break them.They just can’t handle it.That’s one  more straw they can’t handle.So I’m going to try to get through the transition  period and the next guy will have to worry about RMA.”  
- Marshall: Right.- Q2: So he took it on board intellectually, but he wasn’t prepared to do anything  bureaucratically to change the Army in that direction.- Marshall: Yes, right.

[翻譯]
我現在無法要求陸軍參與新軍事革命，因為這將使他們崩潰。他們無法應對這種變革。這是他們無法應對的另一根稻草。所以我將嘗試度過過渡期，下一個人將不得不擔心新軍事革命。
- 馬歇爾: 是的。
- Q2: 所以他在理智上接受了這一點，但從官僚層面上他不準備採取任何行動將軍隊改革朝這個方向轉變。
- 馬歇爾: 是的，對。

--- 段落 88 (236 字元) ---
- Q2: And in fact, you recall last year, he had gotten wind, I guess as a result of the  Army roundtable that we had down at the Training and Doctrine Command, that  there was some disappointment on your—  
- Marshall: Yes [indistinct].

[翻譯]
Q2: 事實上，你記得去年，他得知了一些消息，我想這是因為我們在陸軍戰略指揮學院舉辦的座談會，你對此感到有些失望—
Marshall: 是的。

--- 段落 89 (429 字元) ---
- Q2: —or at least he viewed that as meaning you were disappointed that he hadn’t  done much, so he wanted to talk to you and reassure you that he still thought  this was very important and everything, just too hard to do right now, not on my  watch, you know, the next guy is going to have to do it.- Marshall: Yeah, right, right.Well, I know, but I think Sullivan has a lot of good arguments.I think it is very difficult to do.

[翻譯]
問2：—或至少他認為這意味著您對他沒有做太多感到失望，所以他想與您交談，向您保證他仍然認為這非常重要，但現在做起來太難了，而我不會在位時這麼做，您知道，下一個人得做這件事。— Marshall：是的，對，對。嗯，我明白，但是我覺得蘇利文有很多好的論點。我認為這很難做到。

--- 段落 90 (489 字元) ---
And so…  
- Q2: And, in fact, I think I told you in his most recent meeting with James Blackwell—  I think it’s been like two months ago now—but he laid out in front of Jim his new  slide, I mean, he’s got a set of slides about his vision for the Army.- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: And it now has RMA on there, after Force XXI.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q2: Force XXI is his thing, modernize the force, etc., etc.But he says now there is an  RMA out there and it’s coming after…  
- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
因此...
- Q2: 而事實上，我想我告訴過你在他最近一次與詹姆斯·布拉克韋爾（James Blackwell）的會議中- 我想現在已經有兩個月了- 但他在吉姆面前展示了他對陸軍的願景的新投影片，我是說，他有一套關於陸軍未來的投影片。
- 馬歇爾：是的。
- Q2: 現在在Force XXI之後上面有RMA了。
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。
- Q2: Force XXI是他的想法，現代化軍隊等等。但他現在說有一個RMA在那裡，就在之後...
- 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 91 (442 字元) ---
Well, I’m a patient man…  
- Q2: The Army will be around for a long time.- Marshall: Yes.And…  
- Q3: And he… it was on [indistinct] initiative, from what I understand—you know  more about this than I do—that things like the new 525-5 [indistinct].10  
- Q2: Well, it was, and General Freddie Franks [Commander of U.S.Army Training  and Doctrine Command] also was a key player on that.He personally was a big  believer in information warfare.

[翻譯]
好吧，我是一個耐心的人...
-  Q2：陸軍將長期存在。- 馬歇爾：是的。而且...
-  Q3：而且，根據我所了解的，這是出於某個個人的倡議——你比我更了解這些——像是新的525-5 [無法辨識] 10這樣的事情。
-  Q2：嗯，確實如此，還有美國陸軍訓練與教義部隊指揮官弗雷迪·弗蘭克斯將軍也在其中扮演著關鍵角色。他個人非常相信信息戰。

--- 段落 92 (496 字元) ---
He thought, as did Sullivan, that that was really a  key component of the Army [indistinct], and so they were really trying to get the  525 thing.In the new Field Manual 100-5, as well.- Q3: Less than that.- Q2: And the new Field Manual 100-6, which deals with information warfare.I think  that’s the only Service that has a manual out on information warfare doctrine.Is it  great?No.But, it’s a first step, and so… There clearly were a whole bunch of other  things that the Army could have done.

[翻譯]
他認為，正如蘇利文所認為的那樣，這確實是陸軍的一個關鍵組成部分，所以他們真的很努力想要得到這件事情。在新的100-5處決手冊中也提到了。- Q3: 少於那個數字。- Q2: 還有處理信息戰的新100-6處決手冊。我想這應該是唯一一個有關信息戰學說的服務處決手冊。它很棒嗎？不是。但這是第一步，因此... 陸軍還有很多其他事情可以做。

--- 段落 93 (433 字元) ---
And it’s not just the Army…  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: All the Services could have done a lot more.So it’s nice for Sullivan to say, you  know, “Hey [indistinct]…”  
- Marshall: Well, look, compared to what I thought the problems would be…  
- Q2: That’s right.They were going to firebomb your house, blow up your car, [indistinct].“You’re threatening our organizational essence and all of our toys.”  
- Marshall: Right, right.

[翻譯]
不僅僅是陸軍...
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q2：所有軍種都可以做得更多。所以蘇利文說“嘿[不清楚]...”真是太好了。
- 馬歇爾：嗯，看，與我原先想像的問題相比...
- Q2：沒錯。他們本來打算燒毀你的房子，炸毀你的車，[不清楚]。“你正在威脅我們的組織本質和所有的玩具。”
- 馬歇爾：對，對。

--- 段落 94 (427 字元) ---
- Q2: On the other hand, don’t forget what they did on competitive strategies, which  is, in some way, what they’re doing now on RMA.“We are the RMA.We are competitive strategies.”  
- Marshall: Yes, right, right.- Q2: F-22—RMA!- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q2: I really think the more interesting thing is not what’s happening at the top levels, but what’s happening sort of at the mid and younger levels…  
- Marshall: Yes, right.

[翻譯]
- 問題2：另一方面，不要忘記他們在競爭策略上所做的事情，這在某種程度上正是他們現在在RMA上所做的。“我們是RMA。我們是競爭策略。”
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯，沒錯。- 問題2：F-22—RMA！- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- 問題2：我真的覺得更有趣的事情不是在高層發生的事情，而是在中層和年輕層發生的事情…
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

--- 段落 95 (517 字元) ---
- Q2: We really are developing, within the Army, anyway, and, in some ways, even  as much within the Marine Corps, some within the Navy, less so in the Air Force,  these O-4s, -5s, and -6s that are thinking about this, talking about this, and putting, you know, in place things—like Gary Anderson in the Marine Corps, Chuck  Miller in the Air Force—you know, that are putting in place these kinds of things,  where they’re trying to develop these things intellectually, whether with games,  or workshops, or whatever.

[翻譯]
Q2：無論如何，我們在軍隊內部真的正在發展，而且在某些方面，甚至在海軍陸戰隊中也是如此，在海軍中則較少，在空軍更少，這些四、五、六級軍官正在思考這個問題，討論這個問題，並且實施一些措施─就像海軍陸戰隊的加里·安德森、空軍的查克·米勒─他們正在推動這些事情的實施，嘗試在智力上發展這些事情，無論是通過遊戲、研討會還是其他方式。

--- 段落 96 (482 字元) ---
- Marshall: Right.As I say, I’m a patient person.I don’t expect these things to happen  very quickly.I’m pleased with results thus far, on the whole.- Q2: Your assessment—you said it went to Paul Wolfowitz and the Service chiefs.Did  it go… 
- Marshall: It went to Cheney.In fact, I had a meeting with Cheney.It was a long time  getting it scheduled, and by the time I met with him—it probably was in August  or September [1992]—it really was too late for him to really do anything.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：是的。就像我說的，我是一個有耐心的人。我不指望這些事情很快就會發生。總的來說，對目前的結果我感到滿意。
- Q2：你的評估——你說這份報告交給了保羅·沃爾科維茨和服務參謀長。這份報告是送給了...
- 馬歇爾：是送給了切尼。事實上，我與切尼有過一次會面。安排這次會議花了很長時間，當我最終和他見面時——可能是在1992年8月或9月——對他來說已經太晚了，無法採取任何行動。

--- 段落 97 (417 字元) ---
He  listened, found it interesting, but at that point I think he wasn’t going to try to do  anything.Q2: What about General Colin Powell [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]?Did it  go to Powell?- Marshall: Yes, it went to Powell.- Q2: And what was his reaction?- Marshall: I can’t remember exactly, but it was along the lines of, yes, he thought  that was interesting, but… A number of things were sent to Powell.

[翻譯]
他聽了，覺得很有趣，但我覺得當時他並不打算嘗試做任何事情。問2：關於克林·鮑威爾將軍[聯合參謀會主席]呢？消息有沒有傳到鮑威爾那裡？- 馬歇爾：是的，消息傳到了鮑威爾那裡。- 問2：他有什麼反應？- 馬歇爾：我記不太清楚，但他大概是有點感興趣，但是... 有很多事情都被發送給了鮑威爾。

--- 段落 98 (461 字元) ---
He says some  of the right things, but I don’t think… It was not the kind of thing he was really  interested in.- Q2: Did he ever meet with you on it?- Marshall: No.- Q2: So these were just written responses back to you?- Marshall: Yes, or a phone call, I think.OK.Let me go back and pick up some other things that were going on.One of the  things that we clearly were continuing on was this monitoring of the Soviet Union  as it continued to go down the tubes.

[翻譯]
他說了一些正確的事情，但我不認為...那不是他真正感興趣的事情。問題2: 他有沒有跟你討論過這個？- 馬歇爾：沒有。問題2：所以這些只是書面回覆給你？- 馬歇爾：是的，或者是一通電話，我想。好的。讓我回頭再談一些其他正在進行的事情。我們明顯在繼續監視蘇聯，因為它繼續滑向深淵。

--- 段落 99 (220 字元) ---
Cheney was really very interested in that.For  example, he was very interested in the stuff that Vladimir Shlapentokh was putting out, or other things that we had people put out, people like Vlad Kontorovich  and others.

[翻譯]
Cheney對此非常感興趣。例如，他對Vladimir Shlapentokh發表的東西非常感興趣，或者其他人發表的東西，像是Vlad Kontorovich和其他人。

--- 段落 100 (459 字元) ---
He was also, I thought, very good in the sense that he was not only  interested in the thing, but he had the right instincts, as against the people in the  White House, who had the notion that the Russians had completely changed and  there were never going to be any problems of—  
- Q2: I remember Jonathan Howe [Deputy Assistant to the President for National  Security Affairs, 1991–92] making that argument.- Marshall: —“Gorbachev was wonderful” and so on.

[翻譯]
我認為他也很出色，不僅對事物感興趣，而且他有正確的直覺，與白宮的人相對，他們認為俄羅斯人完全改變了，再也不會出現任何問題——
- Q2: 我記得喬納森·豪 [白宮國家安全事務助理副總統，1991-1992年] 提出了這個論點。
- 馬歇爾：—“戈爾巴喬夫是很棒的”，等等。

--- 段落 101 (430 字元) ---
Cheney was skeptical, in fact,  more skeptical than the people in the Services; for instance, the Joint Staff, who  kind of eliminated all Russian problems—a little premature, from his perspective.He also was very interested in getting people from the outside in, and not confining himself to, “What does the CIA say?” etc.And so there were these meetings  that used to take place on Saturday mornings, of people from the outside.

[翻譯]
切尼是持懷疑態度的，實際上比服務人員更為懷疑；例如聯合參謀會議，他們似乎已經解決了所有俄羅斯的問題—在他看來這有些過早。他也對從外部引進人才非常感興趣，不僅僅依賴“中央情報局的意見”等。因此，曾經在週六早上舉行這些外部人員的會議。

--- 段落 102 (478 字元) ---
Initially,  they were really run by, I guess, Scooter Libby [Principal Deputy Under Secretary  of Defense for Strategy and Resources] [indistinct].But I think before they got  started, I picked the people, based on the guys who’d been right instead of those  who’d been wrong for 20 years.There was some pressure, “Why don’t we have a  more representative sample?” And I said, “The hell with that.Why don’t we pick  the people who have been right and listen to them for a while?

[翻譯]
起初，他們實際上是由我猜是史考特·利比（國防部戰略和資源副部長）所主導的。但在他們開始之前，我選擇了這些人，基於那些在過去20年中做對的人，而不是那些做錯的人。有一些壓力說，“為什麼我們不選擇一個更具代表性的樣本？”我說，“去他媽的。為什麼不選擇那些做對的人並聽取他們的意見一段時間呢？”

--- 段落 103 (478 字元) ---
” And I used to  attend them, but gradually other people took over the actual arrangements and  so on.One of the flaws in the thing was that after the first one, they invited a couple of  the people from CIA, who then tended to talk too much, take up too much of the  time, rather than listening to these other people.My own view was that it was a  mistake to invite them.I mean they could be there like the other people to listen,  but they tried to play their role as experts.

[翻譯]
我曾經參加這些會議，但逐漸地其他人開始負責實際的安排等等。這件事情的一個缺陷是，在第一次會議之後，他們邀請了幾個中央情報局的人，然後這些人往往會講太多、耗費太多時間，而不是聽取其他人的意見。我認為邀請他們是一個錯誤。我的看法是，他們可以像其他人一樣在場聆聽，但他們嘗試扮演專家的角色。

--- 段落 104 (498 字元) ---
Another general point I would make, which I’ve already alluded to, is that I  thought that under Wolfowitz the [Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for]  Policy operation in this building ran better than I have ever seen it run before or  since, really.Also, I think the effort that he undertook that was called the “Bridge  Game,” which was the effort in the last year of the Administration to really address  the question of, “How should we change our policy, strategy over the longer  term?

[翻譯]
另一個一般性觀點我想提出的是，正如我已經提到的那樣，我認為在沃爾科維茨的領導下，這座建築中的國防部次官辦公室的運作比我以前見過的任何時候都要更好，而且事實上至今也是如此。此外，我認為他所進行的所謂“橋牌遊戲”努力，即在政府最後一年實際處理問題，“我們應該如何改變我們的長期政策、策略呢？”。

--- 段落 105 (391 字元) ---
Taking a longer-term look, what should our policy, strategy really be?” It  was the best general effort that I’ve seen of that sort.The one major failure area, I  thought, had to do with the nuclear area, where people, I think, continually have  trouble getting beyond the thinking of the 1950s.Q3: Who were the participants in the “Bridge Game”?- Marshall: There were a whole bunch of them.

[翻譯]
回顧長遠來看，我們的政策和戰略應該是什麼？這是我看到過的最好的一次總體努力。我認為唯一的重大失敗領域與核領域有關，人們似乎無法超越20世紀50年代的思維。問題三：「橋牌遊戲」的參與者是誰？馬歇爾：有很多人。

--- 段落 106 (485 字元) ---
It involved a whole bunch of people,  although it was… The people who came to the meetings depended some on…  Some part of it proceeded on a regional basis, and then the regional people  would come in and so on.But there was, I guess, a core group of people.I forget  who all that was, but there was a group of about maybe eight or ten people.- Q3: You were a member?- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: Dennis Ross?- Q3: Jim Roche?- Marshall: No, Jim wasn’t involved.It was people in the government.

[翻譯]
這牽涉了一群人，雖然它是... 來參加會議的人們有些是依賴於... 一部分是按區域進行的，然後區域的人們會進來之類的。但我想，那裡有一群核心人士。我忘了那些人是誰，但大概有一群人，大概有八到十個人。- Q3：你是成員嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：丹尼斯·羅斯？- Q3：吉姆·羅奇？- 馬歇爾：不，吉姆沒有參與其中。那些是政府中的人。

--- 段落 107 (386 字元) ---
So it was, like,  Scooter Libby and the heads of all the units and some of the other…  
- Q2: Someone like Harry Rowen [Assistant Secretary of Defense for International  Security Affairs], Steve Hadley [Assistant Secretary of Defense for International  Security Policy]?- Marshall: Well, Rowen had gone by that time, I think.- Q2: Was Dennis involved?Ross?Bring anybody over from State?

[翻譯]
所以，像是 Scooter Libby 和所有部門的領導人還有其他一些人...
- Q2: 像是 Harry Rowen（國防部國際安全事務助理部長）、Steve Hadley（國防部國際安全政策助理部長）這樣的人嗎？- Marshall: 嗯，我想 Rowen 那時候已經離開了。
- Q2: Dennis 參與了嗎？Ross？從國務院誰轉過來嗎？

--- 段落 108 (271 字元) ---
- Marshall: No, it was entirely a…DoD [group], people from [the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for] Policy.Now, it came a cropper when it got leaked to the  newspapers and people backed off…  
- Q8: What was the leak?- Q3: This was the DPG leak I assume?Draft?

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：不，這完全是由國防部的人組成，來自政策助理部長辦公室。現在，當這一消息洩露給報紙後，人們退縮了…
- Q8：是什麼洩漏了嗎？- Q3：這是我假設的國防政策指導性文件的洩漏？稿件？

--- 段落 109 (441 字元) ---
- Marshall: No… well, it was a draft… No, it wasn’t a leak of a document… Well, there  was a thing about some of the scenarios, but it was also more this kind of…[gap  for tape change]  
- Marshall: Then I guess we should talk about Desert Storm.- Q2: I don’t know, we went all the way through the ‘60s and ‘70s and didn’t talk about  Vietnam, so we could…  
- Marshall: Right.We didn’t have very much to do with Vietnam.- Q8: A distraction.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：不…嗯，那是一份草案…不，不是文件的洩漏…嗯，有一些情景的事情，但也更多地是這種…[停頓更換錄音帶]
- 馬歇爾：那麼我想我們應該談談沙漠風暴。
- Q2：我不知道，我們一路走過60年代和70年代，都沒有提到過越南，所以我們可能…
- 馬歇爾：對，我們和越南並沒有太多關係。
- Q8：一種分心。

--- 段落 110 (486 字元) ---
Some said the Vietnamese War and the contras’ war were distractions from major strategy.- Marshall: Yeah, right.Well, I have two or three things, not about Desert Storm in general, but just about the involvement of this office in some respects.One thing, of  course, that was interesting was that we were in the midst of the Summer Study  up at Newport when Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait happened [August 1990].- Q2: Did you have a panel on the Middle East and on Iraq going on at the time?

[翻譯]
一些人說越戰和對抗派的戰爭是從主要戰略中分散注意力。馬歇爾：是的，確實是。我有兩三件事情，不是關於沙漠風暴的整體情況，而是關於這個辦公室在某些方面的參與。當時伊拉克入侵科威特發生時（1990年8月），我們正在紐波特進行暑期研究。問題2：當時您是否對中東和伊拉克有任何討論活動？

--- 段落 111 (302 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well we had a panel on new problems in deterrence and we had a panel  on…  
- Q3: Dealing with regional nuclear actors, and we were planning air strikes against  Iraqi nuclear facilities at the time, as I recall.[Indistinct]  
- Marshall: Yes, right.So two of our panels were very relevant.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我們曾就威懾中的新問題舉行過一個小組討論，還有一個小組討論...

Q3：應對地區核能行為者，當時我們正在計劃對伊拉克核設施進行空襲，我記得。[不清楚]

馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。所以我們的兩個小組討論非常相關。

--- 段落 112 (575 字元) ---
The reason we’d had  the panel on deterrence was—I don’t think much of deterrence theory, anyway—  first, that we had had the good luck that the deterrees were the Bolsheviks, with  their focus on rationality and so on, so the theory had a little bit more congruence  with reality than it might otherwise have had, and that in the future, however, a  Russian government might well be a far more traditional, normal political elite,  and there’s no reason to believe that they would be especially characterized by  putting a high value on rationality, calculations, and so on.

[翻譯]
我們之所以討論威懾問題是因為——我本身對威懾理論不太感冒——首先，我們很幸運的是，受到威懾的對象是布爾什維克，他們著重於理性等因素，因此這理論與現實的一致性比其他可能更高；而未來，俄羅斯政府可能會更加傳統，具有正常政治菁英的特徵，並且沒有理由相信他們會特別重視理性、計算等特質。

--- 段落 113 (357 字元) ---
Secondly, some of the people we would be most interested in deterring were  people from other cultures who had nuclear weapons and so on, and we needed  to think about that and what special problems came with that.And, of course, a  lot of that was focused on particularly the people in the Middle East coming from  Arabic cultures.So there was that aspect.

[翻譯]
其次，我們最感興趣的一些人是來自其他文化且擁有核武器等的人，我們需要思考這一點，以及隨之而來的特殊問題是什麼。當然，許多這方面的工作主要集中在中東來自阿拉伯文化的人身上。這就是一個方面。

--- 段落 114 (297 字元) ---
Then there was the thing that Steve Rosen ran, which was looking at, “What do  you really do when these people are about to use them [nuclear weapons], have  just used them, and so on?”  The other thing that happened fairly shortly after that was that I took a trip to Paris in late September ‘90.

[翻譯]
然後是Steve Rosen主持的事情，這是在研究"這些人在即將使用核武器時，真正會做些什麼，剛使用過核武器等等"的情況？ 在那之後不久，我做了一次在1990年9月底前往巴黎的旅行。

--- 段落 115 (435 字元) ---
I forget whether I told this story earlier, but Henri Conze  [then a former French Ministry of Defense official; the French armaments director  at the time of the talk] invited me out to his apartment in Versailles and had a  number of other people for dinner, men from the French military industry.Of  course, we talked about the situation in the Middle East and Iraq.And, of course,  these people had had a lot to do with the Iraqis.

[翻譯]
我忘了我是否早些告訴過這個故事，但亨利·孔茨（當時是一位前法國國防部官員；談話時是法國軍火武器局局長）邀請我去他在凡爾賽宮的公寓，邀請了其他一些人一起吃晚餐，其中有來自法國軍事工業的男士們。當然，我們談論了中東和伊拉克的情況。當然，這些人與伊拉克人有很多接觸。

--- 段落 116 (254 字元) ---
They told me of their appraisal  of the Iraqis, which was that they thought very poorly of the army, the military,  but had great respect for the technical people, the engineers, and the people  that they met in the plants and the laboratories and so on.

[翻譯]
他們告訴我他們對伊拉克人的評價，認為對軍隊和軍方的印象很差，但對技術人員、工程師以及在工廠和實驗室等地方遇到的人有很高的尊重。

--- 段落 117 (369 字元) ---
So their view was, first,  that given this latter characteristic, we shouldn’t underestimate them, and that  they were very capable of doing surprising things, of putting together systems,  technologies, and so on, and so we needed to be wary about that.On the other hand, they thought the army would perform poorly, especially after attack or if  cut off or encircled.

[翻譯]
因此，他們的觀點是，首先，鑒於這一點，我們不應該低估他們，他們有能力做出令人驚訝的事情，組建系統、技術等等，因此我們需要對此保持警惕。另一方面，他們認為軍隊表現會不佳，特別是在遭受攻擊，被切斷或包圍後。

--- 段落 118 (488 字元) ---
Conze came over to the United States about a couple weeks later, and I had a  chance to talk to him again, and asked for more details about why they had  reached their appraisal about the army.He told me that it had come about, or at  least the reason why the people in industry had this view, was that, of course, the  Iraqis were using a lot of French weaponry in the war with Iran, and the French  industry people had wanted to know a lot more about the performance of  their weaponry.

[翻譯]
Conze大約在兩週後來到美國，我有機會再次與他交談，並詢問更多關於他們對軍隊評估的細節。他告訴我，這個評估結果出現的原因，或者至少是工業界人士持有這種觀點的原因，是因為伊拉克在與伊朗戰爭中使用了許多法國武器，而法國工業界人士想要更多了解這些武器的表現。

--- 段落 119 (499 字元) ---
The Iraqis weren’t telling them as much as they wanted, so they  opened up their own effort to find out exactly how their weapons had been used  and how they had performed.It was the by-product of this effort of theirs that  they came to this appraisal of the general competence, performance, morale, and  so on of the Iraqi military establishment.I passed on both of these things to the people in the Joint Staff J-2, the intelligence  people.I don’t think it had much impact on anybody’s judgment.

[翻譯]
伊拉克人並未向他們提供足夠的信息，因此他們展開了自己的努力，以確切了解他們的武器是如何被使用的，以及它們的表現如何。正是由於這個努力所產生的副產品，他們對伊拉克軍事機構的整體能力、表現、士氣等做出了評價。我將這兩件事傳達給聯合參謀部情報人員。我不認為這對任何人的判斷產生了多大影響。

--- 段落 120 (491 字元) ---
You see, I had  urged, “Look, the French seem to know a lot.Why don’t you have some people go  talk to them?” I asked later [in France] whether they had—not all of them—but  asked whether there had been any inquiries or any discussion with these people  on the part of Americans, and they said no.- Q2: Do you know what the assessments were in the Pentagon of the Iraqi military  capabilities?- Marshall: They tended not to rate them as tremendous, but I think they were seen  as comparable.

[翻譯]
你看，我曾經敦促說：“看，法國人似乎知道很多。為什麼不派一些人去跟他們談談呢？” 我之後問 [在法國] 是否有人這樣做－并非全部人－但問到是否有任何美國人和這些人進行過任何詢問或討論，他們說沒有。- 問題2：你知道五角大廈對伊拉克軍事實力的評估是什麼嗎？- 馬歇爾：他們傾向不將其評為強大，但我認為他們被認為是具有可比性的。

--- 段落 121 (452 字元) ---
- Q2: Just let me rephrase that.Cheney and Powell—Do you know their assessments  of the Iraqi military capabilities?- Marshall: I don’t.I don’t know.- Q2: I don’t either, but I do know Brent Scowcroft’s [Assistant to the President or  National Security Affairs]—  
- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: —Which was the same as mine, which was that we were going to beat these  guys very quickly—  
- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q2: —with very few casualties.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
- Q2: 讓我重新說一遍。切尼和鮑威爾──你知道他們對伊拉克軍事能力的評估嗎？
- 馬歇爾：不知道。我不知道。
- Q2: 我也不知道，但我知道布倫特·斯科克羅夫特（總統助理或國家安全事務顧問）的──
- 馬歇爾：是的。
- Q2: ──他的評估和我的一樣，我們都認為我們會很快擊敗這些人──
- 馬歇爾：是的，對。
- Q2: ──且幾乎沒有傷亡。
- 馬歇爾：對。

Now, I think people must have felt some that, for whatever reason,  whether it was based on a low view of the Iraqis, or whether it was intrinsically  that they weren’t competent, or whether we just had overwhelming capabilities.I  do know in talking with Wolfowitz that he said to me at one point, just a few days  before the thing got started, I mean our attack, that he hoped that things were  going to turn out as well as people were assuring him they thought they would.

[翻譯]
現在，我認為人們一定會感到某種程度的疑惑，無論是基於對伊拉克人的低看，還是因為他們本身不夠能幹，或者我們只是有壓倒性的實力。我知道在和沃爾福維茨交談時，他曾告訴我，在我們發動攻擊的幾天前，他希望事情能像人們向他保證的那樣順利。

--- 段落 123 (497 字元) ---
And yet, even then, of course, it turned out better.- Q2: Yeah, even Scowcroft’s projections were not as good as it really turned out.- Marshall: Right.Another thing was that early on we undertook [some quick games]  and turned them over to the people on the Joint Staff.We had put in place a  contract with Mark Herman [at Booz Allen Hamilton] for quick-turnaround games.The guy who was working on the Middle East here, the Army…  
- Q8: Fred Downey?- Marshall: No.- Q2: The colonel?Ned Cabaniss?

[翻譯]
然而，即使那時，事實證明情況變得更好了。- Q2：是的，即使斯考克羅夫特的預測也沒有真正的情況好。- 馬歇爾：對。另一件事是，早期我們進行了一些快速遊戲，並將它們交給了聯合參謀會議的人員。我們已經與 Mark Herman（在博思艾倫漢密爾頓公司）簽訂了一份快速反應遊戲的合同。這裡負責中東事務的人，陸軍的……- Q8：弗雷德·唐尼？- 馬歇爾：不是。- Q2：那位上校？耐德·卡班尼斯？

--- 段落 124 (486 字元) ---
- Marshall: Cabaniss, yeah.He quickly organized the things and so we had some  games done fairly early.I think their orientation was very much, you know, “What  happens if they (the Iraqis] continue on?How do things go?” And those were  turned over to people.But the most direct involvement that we really had was that both Rowen and  Wolfowitz were so busy they asked me to run some panels for them, where we  had people from the outside brought in, experts, to discuss various things.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：卡本尼斯，是的。他很快組織好了事情，所以我們很早就完成了一些遊戲。我認為他們的取向非常清楚，你知道，“如果伊拉克人繼續下去會發生什麼情況？事情怎麼樣發展？”然後這些事情就轉交給其他人處理了。但我們真正直接參與的部分是，羅文和沃爾福維茨都非常忙碌，所以他們請我替他們主持一些小組討論，邀請外部專家來參與，討論各種議題。

--- 段落 125 (488 字元) ---
One  panel that had several meetings—this would be in probably the October, November, December period—were regional and country experts.And the issue was  how well the U.S.was doing in influencing the views of various publics and elites.After all, the U.S.was trying to explain why it was there, what the issues were, and  the view of the Iraqis as the bad guys.And at the same time, the Iraqis were trying  to reach the same kind of publics and elites.The issue was, “How was that going?

[翻譯]
有幾次會議的一個小組討論的主題是區域和國家專家。這可能發生在十月、十一月、十二月期間。議題是美國在影響不同公眾和精英看法方面表現如何。畢竟，美國試圖解釋自己為什麼在那裡，問題是什麼，以及伊拉克人被視為壞人的看法。同時，伊拉克人也在試圖影響同樣的公眾和精英。問題是，“這進展如何？”

--- 段落 126 (419 字元) ---
Is our view doing reasonably well?What are the problems?” and so on.So we had,  I think, probably three meetings of that.They were kind of interesting, but the main thing I came away with was a sense  that there are experts and then there are experts, and some of them were obviously a lot more interesting, a lot more insightful than others.- Q2: Were you actually trying to develop a strategy for shaping perceptions?

[翻譯]
我們的觀點表現得還可以嗎？有什麼問題？”等等。所以我們開了大概三次這樣的會議。它們有點有趣，但我最主要的感受是，專家和專家有區別，有些顯然比其他人更有趣、更有見地。- 問題2：您是否真的在嘗試制定塑造看法的策略？

--- 段落 127 (497 字元) ---
- Marshall: No, it was mainly… Well, other people were…we were just gathering kind  of input and appraisals and so on for them.We also had some meetings and put together some papers as an input to trying  to look at alternative outcomes of the war, and what the longer-term consequences in the region would be.What would be the distribution of power?What  would the region look like depending on…?And three potential outcomes were  posited.- Q2: Were any of them the actual outcome?- Marshall: No.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：不，這主要是…其他人…我們只是在為他們收集各種意見和評估。我們也舉行了一些會議，並將一些文件作為試圖研究戰爭的替代結果以及該地區的長期後果的輸入。權力分配將會是什麼？依賴於…該地區將會是什麼樣子？提出了三個可能的結果。

問題2：有其中任何一個是實際結果嗎？

馬歇爾：沒有。

--- 段落 128 (442 字元) ---
- Q2: You needed more—four possible outcomes.- Marshall: Right.Tried to supply that.The last thing, which maybe would have been potentially the most useful, was  once the ground war began, and it looked very quickly as though we were obviously going to win, Fred Iklé suggested that we ought to really think about the  war termination process.So we had two meetings in which Iklé was one of the participants, but there were some other people.

[翻譯]
問2：您需要更多──四個可能的結果。- 馬歇爾：對。試圖提供這些。最後一件事，也許可能是最有用的，是一旦陸地戰開始，看起來我們顯然會贏得勝利時，弗雷德·伊克勒建議我們真的應該考慮戰爭終結過程。所以我們開了兩次會議，伊克勒是其中一位參與者，但還有其他人在場。

--- 段落 129 (461 字元) ---
And one aspect of it was, looking  at the whole literature that exists on war termination and the problems you can  get into or the things to be avoided, we wanted to try to put together some tailored set of suggestions that came from the literature on things that ought to be  avoided and so on in whatever termination process we got into.Then there was also some set of suggestions about things that might be part of an attractive termination strategy for us.

[翻譯]
有一個層面，是從現有的有關終止戰爭和可能遇到的問題，以及應該避免的事情等方面的整體文獻中尋找。我們希望能夠結合這些建議，對我們可能進行的終止過程提出一些建議。同時，對於一個對我們有吸引力的終止策略，也有一些建議。

--- 段落 130 (400 字元) ---
And those were sent up to Rowen and Wolfowitz.I  don’t know, in all of the scramble at the time, and it all happened so fast, but my guess  is it didn’t have much effect.But it was kind of interesting.It was a useful thing to do.- Q2: Did in any of your possible outcomes or your war termination strategies did you  call for the destruction of the Republican Guard as a condition for war termination?

[翻譯]
這些消息被發送給羅文和沃爾夫維茨。我不知道當時混亂中發生了什麼，一切都發生得很快，但我猜想這並沒有太大影響。但這件事有點有趣。這是一件有用的事情。問2：在你可能的結果或結束戰爭策略中，有沒有呼籲必須摧毀共和衛隊作為結束戰爭的條件？

--- 段落 131 (499 字元) ---
- Marshall: We assumed that that was more or less going to happen, then it was one  of the things that didn’t happen.Another aspect of it was that I remember people were proposing that we remain  and occupy the southern part of Iraq, because you would have a hold over a  major part of the oil fields, and that you would keep this as leverage for the future.Now, in some sense, as things have worked out, that may be not too important,  because we have been able to maintain the embargo on shipping.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我們假設那更多或多或少將會發生，後來卻是一件沒有發生的事情。另一個方面是，我記得有人建議我們留下來佔領伊拉克南部，因為你將控制一個重要的石油田地，並且你將把這作為未來的籌碼。如今，從某種意義上說，事情發展下來，這可能不那麼重要，因為我們已經能夠維持對船運的禁運。

--- 段落 132 (443 字元) ---
- Q2: What about weapons of mass destruction?Does your war termination strategy  call for destroying all their capabilities?- Marshall: No, because we’d sort of assumed that it was already destroyed.We didn’t  know that there were the undiscovered parts of the thing.No, you see, most of it  was procedural and dealt with what not to get sucked into, and things of that sort.- Q3: No talks while fighting, that kind of stuff.- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
問2：質問大規模殺傷性武器呢？你的戰爭終結策略是否包括摧毀所有它們的能力？- 馬歇爾：不，因為我們有點假定它已經被摧毀了。我們不知道還有未發現的部分。你看，大部分都是程序性的，並處理我們不應參與的事情，以及類似的事情。- 問3：戰鬥時不進行談判，這種事情。- 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 133 (402 字元) ---
Now this talk has addressed mainly activities during the Bush Administration.I don’t really have a lot to say about the Clinton period.- Q2: Before you leave the Bush thing… Are you done on Bush?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: One of the things at the start of the Bush Administration that you were involved  with, of course, was the NSR-12 [National Security Review 12] process.- Marshall: Oh yes, that’s true.

[翻譯]
這次講話主要是針對布什政府時期的活動。我對克林頓時期沒有太多話要說。在你談完布什的事情之前... 你對布什講完了嗎？是的。布什政府開始時你參與的其中一個事情當然是NSR-12（國家安全審查12）流程。是的，這是真的。

--- 段落 134 (320 字元) ---
11  
- Q2: That’s not to say that the results of the NSR-12 process were anything we really  want to highlight as being great thinking on the future of the world or anything.- Marshall: Right.- Q2: Nonetheless, it was interesting that you were invited over to participate in that  as a member—  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
11  
- Q2：這並不是說NSR-12過程的結果是我們真的希望強調為世界未來做出了偉大思考的內容。- Marshall：對。- Q2：儘管如此，有趣的是你被邀請參與其中作為一員。- Marshall：是的，對。

--- 段落 135 (280 字元) ---
- Q2: —of the assistant secretary-level group that Paul Wolfowitz chaired while he  was bouncing back and forth between Indonesia and Washington waiting for  confirmation as the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy— 
- Marshall: Right.- Q2: —that you participated in that effort.

[翻譯]
問2：當保羅·沃爾佛維茨在印尼和華盛頓間跳來跳去等待被確認為國防部政策次官時，你參與了他擔任主席的助理秘書級小組嗎？
馬歇爾：是的。- 問2：你參與了那個努力。

--- 段落 136 (500 字元) ---
And I was going to ask you, were there other,  setting aside the Kissinger era, were there other NSC-level efforts comparable that  you directly participated in in terms of attempts to do strategy formulation at the  NSC level?- Marshall: I would say in the Carter period.I mean the thing [Presidential Review  Memorandum 10, “Comprehensive Net Assessment”] that Sam Huntington ran  and so on, which we were very much involved in.12 But I guess those are the  [indistinct].- Q2: Nothing under Reagan?

[翻譯]
我想問你，在基辛格時代之外，除了基辛格時代以外，你直接參與了其他與國家安全會議級別相當的戰略制定努力嗎？- 馬歇爾：我會說在卡特時期。我的意思是山姆·亨廷頓（Sam Huntington）負責的那些事情，比如我們非常參與其中的《總統回顧備忘錄10，“全面凈評估”》。但我猜這些是模糊的。- Q2：在裡根時期沒有其他事情嗎？

--- 段落 137 (423 字元) ---
- Marshall: No.Nothing under Reagan.- Q2: And nothing under Clinton.- Marshall: And this time I don’t think there was anything.In fact, one comment I  would make about the Clinton period is my sense that it’s probably the only administration that I know of that came in that didn’t somehow address these issues  in some systematic way, whatever you thought about how well or poorly they  [the other administrations] did it.

[翻譯]
Marshall：沒有。裡根政府期間也沒有。- Q2：柯林頓政府期間也沒有。- Marshall：而這次我不覺得有任何事情。實際上，我想提及柯林頓時期的一點是，我覺得這可能是我所知道的唯一一個政府，他們上任後沒有以任何系統性的方式處理這些問題，不管你認為他們的處理方式好壞如何。

--- 段落 138 (315 字元) ---
I think this is the only one that I know of that  didn’t really seem to address these issues.Now, maybe this was done, say, as far as  this building was concerned, and in much more informal ways through Secretary  of Defense Les Aspin, but…  Q2: Or maybe it wasn’t done.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: In DoD it wasn’t done.

[翻譯]
我認為這是我所知道的唯一一個，似乎並沒有真正處理這些問題。也許在這棟建築上是這樣，通過國防部長萊斯·阿斯平以更非正式的方式進行，但...問題2：也許這個沒有完成。- 馬歇爾：是的。- 問題3：在美國國防部沒有完成。

--- 段落 139 (460 字元) ---
- Marshall: One other thing to say about the Bush thing is that it was in that administration that because of what was happening with respect to the Soviet Union,  the whole focus of attention of this office really changed.It started out where we  were still looking at some aspects of the situation relative to the Russians, and  then fairly quickly moved on to a very different focus on this power projection  problem, on Asia, and on the MTR and RMA effort.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：關於布什事件還有一點要說的是，在該政府中，由於蘇聯的情況發生了變化，這個辦公室的關注重點真的有了轉變。一開始我們還在看俄羅斯相關情況的某些方面，很快就轉移到了對這個權力投射問題、亞洲和MTR、RMA努力的非常不同的關注重點上。

--- 段落 140 (453 字元) ---
Q3: I just have one small question about your effort to study the Soviet Union in  Chapter 11.Did you sponsor John Hines’s work with the Soviet general officers?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q3: And it was as part of that effort that he got some insights into the Soviet nuclear  command procedures.- Marshall: Yeah.In fact, we finally have the draft…  
- Q2: 160 pages.- Marshall: Yeah, it needs a little editing, but I read the thing and it’s really pretty good.

[翻譯]
Q3：我只有一個關於你在第11章研究蘇聯方面的努力的小問題。你贊助了約翰·海恩斯與蘇聯將軍合作的工作嗎？- 馬歇爾：對。- Q3：正是在這一努力的過程中，他獲得了一些關於蘇聯核指揮程序的見解。- 馬歇爾：對。事實上，我們最終有了初稿......- Q2：160頁。- 馬歇爾：對，它需要一點編輯，但我看過這份文件，實際上相當不錯。

--- 段落 141 (428 字元) ---
- Q3: Yeah, you just mentioned a couple of things out of it.It seems to be really  interesting.- Marshall: Yeah, right.Of course, it’s gone on for quite a long time.It looked to me like there was this period where there would be an opportunity to go and talk  with these people, and it wouldn’t last forever.So I started John Hines on that as  a way of trying to understand, “What did they really do?What were their assessments?

[翻譯]
Q3：是的，你剛剛提到了其中幾件事情。這看起來真的很有趣。- Marshall：是的，確實。當然，這已經進行了相當長的時間。在我看來，似乎有這樣一段時間，可以去和這些人談話，但這個機會不會永遠存在。所以我開始著手約翰·海因斯這件事，試圖了解他們到底做了什麼？他們的評估是什麼？

--- 段落 142 (415 字元) ---
What can we find about the actual methods, techniques that they really  used in the General Staff for making assessments?”  
- Q2: Focused on the nuclear issue.- Marshall: Well, this is on the nuclear issue.But there were earlier things that were  broader: How did they look at the correlation of forces and so on.- Q2: And have you got stuff on that?I mean, did you get stuff—  
- Marshall: Yeah, got some of that.

[翻譯]
在參謀總長部門真正用於進行評估的實際方法和技術上，我們可以找到什麼呢？
- 問題2：專注於核問題。- 馬歇爾：嗯，這是有關核問題的。但之前有更廣泛的事情：他們如何看待兵力對比等等。- 問題2：你有相關資料嗎？我的意思是，你有獲得相關資料嗎？
- 馬歇爾：是的，有一些。

--- 段落 143 (468 字元) ---
- Q2: —that confirmed that we were on the right track, or we weren’t on the right  track, or…?- Marshall: We were sort of, I think, on the right track.Although,
