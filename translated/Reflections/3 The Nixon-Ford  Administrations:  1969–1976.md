## Introduction ## 
 When President Richard Nixon entered office in 1969, the United States military was  deeply embroiled in the war in Vietnam.Although the totals had declined slightly  from their peak the previous year, there were still more than 535,000 U.S.troops  in South Vietnam and little prospect of victory.2 The Tet Offensive in 1968, during  which Communist forces suffered 37,000 casualties, was a tactical failure but a  strategic victory for the North Vietnamese.

[翻譯]
##簡介##
1969年，當理查德·尼克松總統就職時，美國軍隊深深地卷入了越南戰爭。雖然與前一年的高峰相比，部隊數量稍有下降，但在南越仍有超過535,000名美軍，並且幾乎沒有勝利的前景。1968年的春節進攻中，共產黨軍隊遭受了37,000人傷亡，雖然戰術上失敗，但在北越卻是一場戰略勝利。

It seriously set back U.S.efforts to pacify  the countryside, terrified the civilian population of South Vietnam, and inflicted  more U.S.casualties than the American public was willing to tolerate.The war was  sparking growing domestic protests and squeezing defense budgets.The diversion  of troops and equipment from Europe to Vietnam and the morale and readiness  problems resulting from years of military operations also reduced the deterrent value of U.S.forces against the Soviet Union.

[翻譯]
這場戰爭嚴重阻礙了美國安撫鄉村的努力，讓南越的民間人口感到恐懼，並造成比美國公眾願意承受的更多美國傷亡。這場戰爭引發越來越多的國內抗議，並對國防預算造成壓力。將軍隊和裝備從歐洲調派到越南，以及年久軍事行動所帶來的士氣和準備問題，也降低了美國軍隊對抗蘇聯的威懾力。

Civilian leaders in the United States adopted a new approach—Vietnamization—that sought to decrease U.S.involvement by  improving and modernizing South Vietnam’s forces so they could assume a greater  share of the burden and allow U.S.forces to withdraw.3 Vietnamization was adopted  as official U.S.policy after a National Security Council review in the spring of 1969.4  Vietnamization represented what later became known as the Nixon Doctrine.

[翻譯]
美國的民間領導人採取了一種新方法 - 越南化，旨在通過改善和現代化南越軍隊來減少美國的參與，使他們能夠承擔更大的負擔，並允許美國軍隊撤退。越南化在1969年春季國家安全委員會審查後成為官方美國政策。越南化代表了後來被稱為尼克松主義的理念。

During an impromptu press conference in Guam in July 1969, Nixon outlined his  views that U.S.allies should contribute more manpower for their own defense.The  United States would continue to honor its treaty commitments, including providing  military and economic assistance, and would furnish a nuclear umbrella to its allies,  but would encourage and expect its allies to assume primary responsibility for their  own defense.

[翻譯]
1969年7月，在關島舉行的一次即興記者招待會上，尼克松概述了他的觀點，即美國盟友應該為自己的國防增加更多人力。美國將繼續遵守其條約承諾，包括提供軍事和經濟援助，並向其盟友提供核傘，但將鼓勵並期望其盟友主要負責自己的國防。

--- 段落 5 (450 字元) ---
Nixon explained, “[W]e must avoid the kind of policy that will make  countries…so dependent upon us that we are dragged into conflicts such as the  one we have in Vietnam.”5  While the United States was heavily engaged in Vietnam, the number of Soviet strategic missiles had grown substantially.By 1969, Soviet nuclear warheads  totaled more than 10,500—far fewer than the 27,500 warheads in the U.S.arsenal  but a nearly ten-fold increase from 1960.

[翻譯]
尼克松解釋說：「我們必須避免那種政策，讓其他國家對我們如此依賴，以至於我們被拖入像越南這樣的衝突中。」當美國在越南大規模投入時，蘇聯戰略導彈的數量已大幅增長。到了1969年，蘇聯核彈頭總數超過10,500枚，遠遠少於美國武器庫中的27,500枚核彈頭，但相較於1960年的數量增長了近十倍。

--- 段落 6 (490 字元) ---
6 Nixon wanted to change the character  of America’s relationship with the Soviet Union from confrontation to negotiation,  and he sought to initiate talks on strategic arms.A prerequisite for serious strategic  arms limitation talks, however, was the deployment of an antiballistic missile (ABM) system.The Soviets had already begun deploying a system around Moscow; Nixon  believed that if the United States did not have its own system, it would have less  leverage during the arms talks.

[翻譯]
尼克松希望改變美國與蘇聯的關係性質，從對抗轉為談判，並尋求啟動戰略武器談判。然而，進行嚴肅的戰略武器限制談判的先決條件是部署反彈道飛彈系統。蘇聯已經開始在莫斯科周圍部署系統；尼克松相信，如果美國沒有自己的系統，它在談判中將會更少有籌碼。

--- 段落 7 (445 字元) ---
In 1969, the Senate approved funding for an ABM  system by one vote.7  The approval paved the way for the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) in November 1969.The first SALT Treaty was signed in May 1972, in Moscow.The treaty limited  the number of ABM launchers to 200 for each nation, although the number was  halved two years later.The systems would be limited to the defense of the national  capitals and one missile site in each country.

[翻譯]
1969年，參議院以一票之差批准了一項反彈道飛彈（ABM）系統的資金。這項批准為1969年11月的戰略武器限制談判（SALT）鋪平了道路。第一份SALT條約於1972年5月在莫斯科簽署。該條約限制了每個國家的ABM發射裝置數量為200台，儘管兩年後這一數量減半。這些系統將僅限於保護各國的首都和一個導彈發射基地。

--- 段落 8 (477 字元) ---
The treaty also halted construction of  additional fixed land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launchers and  limited the number of modern ballistic missile submarines and submarine-launched  ballistic missiles (SLBMs).Among the more controversial aspects of the treaty were  the provisions that allowed the Soviet Union more ICBMs and SLBMs than the  United States and the omission of any mention of Multiple Independently Targeted Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs).U.S.

[翻譯]
也停止了建造額外的固定陸基洲際彈道導彈發射器，並限制了現代彈道導彈潛艇和潛艇發射的彈道導彈（SLBM）的數量。該條約中較具爭議的方面包括蘇聯允許擁有更多的ICBM和SLBM比美國，以及未提及多重獨立目標再入載具（MIRVs）。

--- 段落 9 (470 字元) ---
critics of the treaty feared that once the Soviets  equipped all of their missiles with MIRVs, their numerical advantage would increase  substantially, enabling greater flexibility and a strategic advantage.8  The emergence of nuclear parity between the superpowers coincided with a decline  in U.S.conventional military capabilities.The war in Vietnam weakened Congressional support for military spending, which impacted force structure.Between  1969 and 1976, the U.S.

[翻譯]
擁護該條約的批評者擔心，一旦蘇聯為所有導彈裝備多重獨立目標再入彈頭（MIRVs），他們在數量上的優勢將顯著增加，提供更大的靈活性和戰略優勢。兩個超級大國之間核平衡的出現與美國常規軍事實力的下降相互呼應。越戰削弱了美國國會對軍事支出的支持，進而影響了軍事力量結構。從1969年到1976年，美國的...

defense budget decreased by nearly 29 percent in constant  dollars, while active duty endstrength declined almost 40 percent.The number of  tactical fighter squadrons in the Air Force fell from 93 to 69; the number of ships  in the Navy dropped from 885 to 536; the Marine Corps shrunk from 310,000 to  192,000 marines, and the Army contracted from 1,512,000 to 779,000 soldiers.The  cuts restricted the U.S.capacity to project conventional military power.

[翻譯]
國防預算以恆定美元計算下降了近29％，而現役人數下降了近40％。美國空軍的戰術戰鬥機中隊數從93架下降到69架；海軍艦艇數量從885艘下降到536艘；海軍陸戰隊人數從310,000名減少到192,000名海軍陸戰隊員，陸軍人數也從1,512,000人減少到779,000人。這些削減限制了美國展示傳統軍事力量的能力。

9  In Western Europe, the United States sought to rationalize NATO’s defense investments by convincing European allies to buy U.S.weapons in areas where American  technology was superior, while the Americans would purchase European weapons  when they were better.Several European states agreed to buy U.S.F-16 fighters and  the United States agreed to purchase the Roland II, a Franco-German short-range  air defense system.

[翻譯]
在西歐，美國試圖通過說服歐洲盟國在美國技術優勢的領域購買美國武器，來合理化北約的防禦投資，而當歐洲盟國的武器更好時，美國將採購歐洲武器。幾個歐洲國家同意購買美國的F-16戰鬥機，而美國同意購買羅蘭德II，這是一種法國-德國的短程防空系統。

--- 段落 12 (475 字元) ---
The United States also pushed NATO to approve a Long-Range  Defense Concept that envisioned a capability to defend Western Europe without  quickly resorting to nuclear weapons.The resultant document, approved in May  1975, placed a “major emphasis” on conventional capabilities but noted that those  capabilities would require only a “modest annual increase in real terms in defense  expenditure” because “NATO has already achieved a large measure of success in this  regard.

[翻譯]
美國還推動北約批准了一個遠程防衛概念，該概念設想了在不迅速訴諸核武器的情況下捍衛西歐的能力。結果出來的文件於1975年5月批准，它強調常規能力，但指出這些能力只需要“在國防支出方面實際增長較小的年度增長”，因為“在這方面，北約已經取得了相當大的成功”。

--- 段落 13 (388 字元) ---
” In the end, the improvements in NATO defense capabilities were limited.10  Although the SALT Treaty was intended to ease the nuclear competition with the  Soviet Union, the Soviets were no longer the only nuclear-armed U.S.competitor.China detonated its first nuclear weapon in 1964 and its first thermonuclear weapon  in 1967.By 1969, China possessed approximately 50 nuclear warheads.

[翻譯]
最後，北約國防能力的改善是有限的。儘管《SALT條約》旨在緩和與蘇聯之間的核競爭，蘇聯不再是唯一擁有核武器的美國競爭對手。中國在1964年引爆了第一枚核武器，並在1967年引爆了第一枚氫彈。到1969年，中國擁有約50枚核彈頭。

11 The Nixon  Administration undertook a number of reviews beginning in 1969 to identify  options for dealing with the potential Chinese threat as it decreased the presence  of U.S.troops in Asia.Nixon, however, began to doubt the policy of isolating China over the long term.Skirmishes between Soviet and Chinese forces along the SinoSoviet border in March 1969 gave Nixon an opportunity to exploit the growing  Sino-Soviet split.

[翻譯]
尼克松政府從1969年開始進行了一系列審查，以找到應對潛在中國威脅的選項，同時在亞洲降低美軍駐軍的存在。然而，尼克松開始對長期孤立中國的政策產生疑慮。1969年3月中蘇邊界發生的軍事小衝突讓尼克松有機會利用這種增長的中蘇分歧。

--- 段落 15 (323 字元) ---
After another two years of debate within the administration, Nixon  announced on 15 July 1971 that he would visit China in 1972.In the communique  issued at the end of Nixon’s visit, the United States and China agreed to begin moving  toward normal diplomatic relations and not to seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific  region.

[翻譯]
經過另外兩年的內部辯論後，尼克森於1971年7月15日宣布他將於1972年訪問中國。在尼克森訪問結束時發表的聯合公報中，美國和中國同意開始朝著建立正常外交關係的方向前進，並不會在亞太地區尋求霸權。

12  In the Middle East, Egypt and Syria, still smarting from their disastrous defeat at the  hands of the Israelis in the 1967 Six-Day War, launched a simultaneous attack against  Israel on 6 October 1973.The Israelis were caught by surprise and suffered heavy  losses, but committed mobilized personnel and equipment to battle as rapidly as  they reported for duty.After 8 days of fighting, the Israelis had stabilized the Syrian  front and turned their attention to the Sinai.

[翻譯]
在中東地區，埃及和敘利亞對1967年六天戰爭中以色列人的慘敗仍心有不甘，於1973年10月6日同時對以色列發動進攻。以色列人受到突襲，遭受重大損失，但他們快速動員人員和裝備參戰，一報到就投入戰鬥。經過8天的激戰，以色列人穩住了敘利亞戰線，並將注意力轉向西奈。

By 24 October, they had moved three  armored divisions across the Suez Canal and cut off the Egyptian 3rd Army from the  remainder of the Egyptian forces.13  Early in the conflict, the U.S.national security establishment came to view the  October War as a potential battle laboratory.It presented a unique opportunity to  collect information on the performance of modern weapons and the effectiveness  of tactics, techniques, and procedures.

[翻譯]
到10月24日，他們已經將三個裝甲師跨越蘇伊士運河，切斷了埃及第三軍與其餘埃及部隊的聯繫。在衝突初期，美國國家安全機構開始將十月戰爭視為一個潛在的戰鬥實驗室。這提供了一個獨特的機會，收集有關現代武器性能和戰術、技術和程序有效性的信息。

When Israel realized that it was running out  of critical military supplies, particularly munitions, and turned to the United States  for help, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger demanded a quid pro quo.In exchange  for providing Israel with additional ammunition, fighter aircraft, and other war materials, the United States would have the opportunity to study the war up close shortly  after it ended.14

[翻譯]
當以色列意識到關鍵軍事裝備，特別是彈藥，即將用盡，並向美國尋求幫助時，國務卿亨利·基辛格要求交換條件。作為提供以色列額外彈藥、戰鬥機和其他戰爭物資的交換，美國將有機會在戰爭結束後不久近距離研究戰爭。

### 1969–1975

[翻譯]
1971年，馬來西亞在東本貝歇爾島發現石油，使其成為馬來西亞的主要出口商品。1972年，馬來西亞與中華人民共和國建交。在此期間，馬來西亞進行了內部經濟和政治改革，以加強國家的統一和繁榮。

--- 段落 34 (433 字元) ---
- Marshall: I targeted to talk about the period from September of ‘69 through  January of ‘81.I’m not sure we are going to make it.I think there may be too  much.At any rate, my notes run out a little bit before then.It’s really the period of  the first chunk of my time in government, up essentially to the end of the Carter  Administration.I thought also that I would go back and say a bit about some important antecedents to this.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我打算談論從1969年的九月到1981年的一月這段時間。我不確定我們是否會完成。我覺得可能會太多了。無論如何，我的筆記在那之前有些不足。這實際上是我在政府工作的第一段時間，基本上是到卡特政府結束。我也想回顧一下一些重要的前因。

--- 段落 35 (460 字元) ---
Now, we’ve covered some of this already, but not in, as I got through  it, as much detail, or things had been left out in the earlier discussion, because  they weren’t, in some sense, intellectually that important.There’s a bunch of antecedents in my relations with the intelligence community, or the intelligence area.There is this kind of precursor work that I did on net  assessment while at RAND, and then there is this long-term competition set of  ideas.

[翻譯]
現在，我們已經涵蓋了一些內容，但在我通過它時，並沒有那麼詳細，或者在之前的討論中有些內容被省略，因為從某種意義上說，它們在智力上並不重要。在我與情報界或情報領域的關係中有許多前人。在蘭德研究所時我做過的關於網絡評估的前期工作，然後有這一套長期競爭的想法。

--- 段落 36 (483 字元) ---
Also it might be worth talking a little bit about my previous involvement in  government [indistinct] stems [indistinct] RAND.A number of these things have  an impact on the bureaucratic strategy I adopted.So the period, I think, has something like the following breakup to it: From September  of ‘69 to January of ‘72, I was really at RAND, but working a lot for Henry Kissinger  when he was Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.Really about  half time, I think.

[翻譯]
同時，也許值得稍微談談我的過去在政府中的參與，這與我在蘭德研究所（RAND）的參與有關。這些事情中有許多對我採取的官僚策略產生了影響。所以我認為這段時期大致可以分為以下幾個部分：從1969年9月到1972年1月，我主要在蘭德研究所工作，但當時亦為亨利·基辛格（Henry Kissinger）（當時擔任國家安全事務助理總統）工作了很多。我想大約是一半的時間。

--- 段落 37 (428 字元) ---
Also, because James Schlesinger had left RAND in, I suppose,  January of ‘69 to join the Nixon Administration, I was also doing consulting with  Schlesinger at the Office of Management and Budget.And so, you want to cover  some of those kinds of things.Then there’s the period of January [April] ‘72 through November [October] of ‘73,  when I was actually on the National Security Council staff, and we need to talk  about that.

[翻譯]
另外，因為詹姆斯·施萊辛格在大約1969年1月離開了蘭德公司加入尼克松政府，我也在管理和預算局與施萊辛格進行諮詢。因此，您想要談談這些事情。接著是1972年1月[至4 月]至1973年11月[至10月]的時期，我實際上在國家安全委員會工作，我們需要談談這段經歷。

--- 段落 38 (414 字元) ---
Now, simultaneously with that, Schlesinger left OMB [Eds: Office of  Management and Budget], went to the Atomic Energy Commission, and then  he became the Director of Central Intelligence.And I spent a fair amount of time  talking with him or wrote things for him during that period.And then, there’s the period of November ‘73 to January ‘81, here in Defense, with  Schlesinger, Donald Rumsfeld, and Harold Brown.

[翻譯]
與此同時，施萊辛格離開了OMB（即管理和預算辦公室），轉而去了原子能委員會，然後成為中央情報局局長。在那段時間裡，我花了相當多的時間與他交談，為他寫東西。然後，在1973年11月至1981年1月的這段時間，與施萊辛格、唐納德·倫斯菲爾德和哈羅德·布朗一起在國防部工作。

--- 段落 39 (346 字元) ---
So I guess I will just talk about some of this and about particularly these antecedents, just to kind of list some things.The intelligence world: As I mentioned earlier, I had gotten drawn into that by  the work I was doing at RAND quite early because a lot of it was connected with  targeting the Soviet economy.I got very much involved in that.

[翻譯]
所以我想我只會談論一些這方面的事情，尤其是這些前因後果，只是列出一些事情。情報界：正如我之前提到的，我很早就被捲入了這個領域，這是因為我在蘭德公司的工作與瞄準蘇聯經濟有很大的關聯。我非常投入其中。

--- 段落 40 (418 字元) ---
But probably the most important thing was in ‘52 there had been a request to  RAND from the man, his name was General Millard “Poppy” Lewis, who was the  chief intelligence officer to USAF in Wiesbaden.Among the topics he wanted  worked on was strategic warning.Jim Digby and I were asked to work on that.We  ended up, I ended up spending five months in Germany, in Wiesbaden working  on the strategic warning problem.

[翻譯]
但可能最重要的事情是在1952年，美國空軍駐維斯巴登的情報主管米拉德·"波比"·路易斯將軍向蘭德公司提出了一項請求。他希望研究戰略預警等問題。吉姆·迪格比和我被要求參與這個工作。最終，我花了五個月的時間在德國的維斯巴登解決戰略預警問題。

--- 段落 41 (344 字元) ---
16 Then in ‘55, ‘56, Joseph Loftus and I, again, were working on the strategic warning  problem, again, for the Air Force.But by that time, the Air Force had created a  worldwide warning system where there were particular nodes.One was in Alaska,  which we went to and stayed a week or so at that.Another was in Japan, and we  spent time there.

[翻譯]
然後在1955、1956年，約瑟夫·洛夫塔斯和我再次為空軍解決戰略警告問題。但那時，空軍已建立了一個全球警告系統，其中有特定節點。一個位於阿拉斯加，我們去過那裡並在那裡逗留了大約一個星期。另一個位於日本，我們也在那裡花了一些時間。

--- 段落 42 (478 字元) ---
Also, because of the nature of the information available then, we  spent a lot of time out in the field in various communications intelligence collection centers.And also spent a couple of days, I think, in Hawaii.At any rate, I was  very much involved in the COMINT world; I mean the strategic warning problem.17  Then, in ‘56 [1958], I became a Central Intelligence Agency consultant, which  lasted through to the time I joined the government.- Q2: You were no longer at RAND?

[翻譯]
另外，由於當時可得到的資訊的性質，我們花了很多時間在不同的通訊情報收集中心進行戶外工作。還有一天或兩天，在夏威夷。無論如何，我非常投入於通訊情報（COMINT）世界；我的意思是戰略預警問題。然後，在1958年，我成為了中央情報局的顧問，這一直持續到我加入政府的時間。 - Q2：您不再在RAND了嗎？

--- 段落 43 (484 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yeah I was at RAND.- Q2: But you were going to work for the CIA?- Marshall: Yes, as a consultant, right.Then in ‘57 through maybe ‘63, with Loftus, I ran  this Sovoy project that we talked about before.18  But probably more significant from the connection to the intelligence community  was that when I returned from France, in the spring of ‘65, I was asked to come  and talk with John Bross, who I had not known at all before.I don’t know quite  why he wanted to see me.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：是的，我曾在蘭德研究所工作。
- Q2：但您原本打算加入中央情報局嗎？
- 馬歇爾：是的，作為顧問，沒錯。然後在1957年到大概1963年期間，我和洛夫特斯一起運行了我們之前提到過的蘇瓦計畫。但也許更重要的是，和情報界的聯繫是，在我在1965年春季從法國返回時，我被要求去和約翰·布羅斯談話，我之前根本不認識他。我不太清楚他為什麼要見我。

--- 段落 44 (483 字元) ---
But, at any rate, we talked, I think probably based  on some of the things that Loftus and I had published about how to improve  estimates and forecasts.Bross had been set up by John McCone [Director of  Central Intelligence, 1961–1965] with something called the office of National  Intelligence Programs Evaluation, the NIPE staff, which was the predecessor of the  Intelligence Community staff, eventually.19 Bross had been an Office of Strategic  Services officer in World War II.

[翻譯]
但無論如何，我們談論了，我想可能是基於洛夫塔斯和我發表的一些關於如何改進估算和預測的 東西。布羅斯被約翰·麥康（中央情報總監，1961年至1965年）設立了一個名為國家情報計畫評估辦公室（NIPE）的部門，這是情報界工作人員的前身。布羅斯曾是二戰時期的戰略情報局（OSS）人員。

--- 段落 45 (374 字元) ---
Really one of the “princes of the realm” within the  CIA establishment and clandestine services.He had probably started with a lot  of money, had made a lot of money on Wall Street, married one of the Marshall  Fields daughters.Anyway, he liked me.There were very few consultants for the NIPE staff.It was quite small, and there  were just two or three consultants, I think.

[翻譯]
他真的是中情局機構和秘密服務中的“王子”之一。他可能一開始就有很多錢，在華爾街賺了很多錢，娶了一位馬歇爾菲爾兹女兒。不管怎樣，他喜歡我。NIPE團隊幾乎沒有顧問，人數很少，我想只有兩三個顧問。

--- 段落 46 (441 字元) ---
So I came to learn a lot about the  top-management kind of problems from his perspective and advising Richard  Helms [DCI, 1966–1973], who he was a close friend of.That connection continued,  again, also up until the time I joined the government.So from the early ‘50s on, I had been pretty involved in intelligence, particularly  this connection with Bross was from this period.At any rate, it opened up a lot of  issues and problems to me.

[翻譯]
因此，我從他的角度學到了很多關於高層管理層問題的知識，並向他的好友理查德·海爾姆斯（1966-1973年任中情局局長）提供建議。這種聯繫一直持續下去，直到我加入政府為止。所以從50年代初開始，我在情報工作上相當參與，特別是與布洛斯的這種聯繫是從這個時期開始的。無論如何，這使我接觸到了很多問題和困難。

--- 段落 47 (466 字元) ---
On the net assessment thing, I think I’ve already mentioned the papers I wrote  for Fred Wikner, and probably we will have to go back to the RAND efforts and  locate some papers that I wrote then, Research Memoranda and so on.Wikner  had set up the Net Technical Assessment effort in the Defense Department.It was  probably set up in ‘67, so somehow during ‘68, ‘69, I spent time working on some  problems for Wikner, and I can’t quite remember exactly what I wrote.

[翻譯]
在網路評估方面，我想我已經提到我為弗雷德·威克納寫的論文，也許我們將不得不回到蘭德機構的努力，找到一些我當時寫的論文、研究備忘錄等等。威克納在國防部建立了網路技術評估工作。這可能是在‘67年建立的，所以在‘68年、‘69年期間，我花了一些時間為威克納解決一些問題，我無法確切記得我當時寫了什麼。

--- 段落 48 (431 字元) ---
But then  that’s something we can search in the RAND library.20 Then, in addition, with regard to my previous governmental kind of connections…in ‘57, I was a member of the Gaither Committee staff, and involved with  that from about August through December.21 In ‘58 [Aug–Dec], I was involved  in the preparation and as a member of the delegation that went to Geneva in  connection with the Surprise Attack talks with the Russians.

[翻譯]
但這是我們可以在蘭德圖書館搜索到的內容。此外，關於我之前與政府的聯繫...在1957年，我是蓋瑟委員會的工作人員之一，參與該委員會工作，從八月到十二月。在1958年（八月至十二月），我參與了有關與俄羅斯人談論意外襲擊的日內瓦談判準備工作，並作為代表團的成員前往日內瓦。

--- 段落 49 (344 字元) ---
22 Then in ‘61, I was on  a special subgroup of the McCloy arms control study that was set up right after  the Kennedy Administration took over, that looked at nuclear accidents and what  you could do to prevent that.My work for that group went back over the whole  history of the whole series of close calls we had.23  
- Q2: Who was that for?

[翻譯]
在1961年，我參與了麥克洛伊軍備控制研究的一個特殊小組，該小組是在肯尼迪政府接手後成立的，專門研究核事故以及如何預防核事故。我的工作環繞整個我們所經歷的一系列幾次幾乎發生的危險事件的歷史。這是為了誰？

--- 段落 50 (442 字元) ---
- Marshall: It was run out of the State Department, at the time, but the other people  on the thing were—well, I guess Paul Nitze came over to testify—but people like  Marv Stem, Thomas Schelling, me… I forget some of the other people now, but  there were maybe six, eight of us.24  
- Q2: Was that Policy Planning?- Marshall: Could have been.- Q2: It wasn’t intelligence, it wasn’t the Bureau of Intelligence and Research?- Marshall: No, no.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：當時它是由國務院負責，但其他參與其中的人包括，嗯，我想保羅·尼茨前來作證，但像是馬文·斯坦姆、托馬斯·舍林、還有我...我現在忘了一些其他人，但大概有六、八個人吧。
- Q2：那是政策規劃嗎？
- 馬歇爾：可能是。
- Q2：不是情報工作，也不是情報研究局？
- 馬歇爾：不，不是。

--- 段落 51 (471 字元) ---
Then in the immediate aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis, I was involved in  some of the efforts to follow what was continuing to go on, but also this issue of  what had the Russians maybe learned from the thing and so on.Then…  
- Q2: That was for the CIA?- Marshall: No, that was for Harry Rowen, a Defense Department thing, because  Rowen had come to Washington, along with Charles Hitch and several others  from RAND at the beginning of the Kennedy Administration.

[翻譯]
在古巴飛彈危機發生後不久，我參與了一些跟進情況的努力，並且關注俄羅斯人可能從中學到的事情等等。然後...
- Q2：那是為了中央情報局嗎？- 馬歇爾：不是，那是為了哈里·羅文（Harry Rowen），一個國防部的事情，因為羅文在肯尼迪政府開始時和查爾斯·希奇（Charles Hitch）以及幾位其他人一起從蘭德公司來到華盛頓。

--- 段落 52 (499 字元) ---
25  From August of ‘63 through about March of ‘65, I lived in Paris and was part of a delegation to NATO.26 In the course of that, Rowen had me go head a delegation, make  a couple of visits to Norway, because the Norwegians had approached the U.S.,  wanting kind of bilateral discussions about the defense of Norway.27 In their view, if  you looked at AFNorth [Eds: Allied Forces Northern Europe], and who was supposed  to come to help them, the U.S.was not very well represented in AFNorth at all.

[翻譯]
從1963年8月到1965年3月左右，我住在巴黎並且是北約的代表團成員。在那期間，羅恩讓我領導一個代表團，幾次去挪威訪問，因為挪威人已經接觸美國，希望進行關於挪威防衛的雙邊討論。在他們看來，如果看了AFNorth（歐洲北部盟軍部隊）和誰應該前來幫助他們，美國在AFNorth中代表的地位並不太好。

--- 段落 53 (402 字元) ---
Yet the  only people they had any faith in who were ever going to come and help them was  the U.S.So they wanted to open direct discussions about what was really going to  happen, as against purported NATO plans for what was going to happen.So I did that.And then, in the period around probably ‘66, ‘67 [1965/66], Schlesinger and I were  consultants to Rowen when he was at OMB [Bureau of the Budget].

[翻譯]
然而，唯一他們對會來幫助他們有信心的人只有美國。所以他們希望開始直接討論實際將發生的事情，而不是聯合國北約計劃中所宣稱的事情。所以我們做到了。然後，在大約1966年至1967年的時期，施萊辛格和我就成為羅文在負責預算的OMB時的顧問。

--- 段落 54 (322 字元) ---
28 Some of  it was related to defense, but a lot of it was related to this effort that President  Lyndon Johnson started to try to spread the wonderful cost-effectiveness analysis  to the rest of the government.29 Anyway, Rowen asked us to help on that.I’ve already mentioned this consulting to Bross from ‘65 through ‘72.

[翻譯]
28 這些內容有些與防衛有關，但很多是關於林登·約翰遜總統開展的努力，嘗試將成本效益分析傳播到政府的其他部分。29 無論如何，羅文要求我們在這方面提供幫助。我已經提到了從1965年到1972年對布羅斯的這種諮詢。

--- 段落 55 (494 字元) ---
The other kind of antecedent thing that I think is worth talking a little bit about is  the kind of bureaucratic strategy I adopted when I finally did actually get in government, which, on reflection, seems to me to reflect the impact of my interest in  organizational behavior and studies, things I have been thinking about since the  late ‘50s.Based on all of that, I had the view that organizations were pretty hard to  change, and to influence very much, and that timing was very important.

[翻譯]
我認為值得談論一下的另一種先行事物是我最終進入政府時採用的一種官僚策略，回想起來，我認為這反映了我對組織行為和研究的興趣，這些事情自50年代末以來我一直在思考。基於這一切，我認為組織很難改變，影響力很大，而且時機非常重要。

--- 段落 56 (254 字元) ---
It also, even when I was at RAND, had led me to feel that the RAND way of conveying the results of studies was very poor.In the first place, the studies themselves  were often not very tailored to the organizations that you were really trying to  change.

[翻譯]
這也讓我感覺到，即使我在蘭德公司，蘭德公司傳遞研究結果的方式非常不好。首先，這些研究本身往往並不完全符合你真正試圖改變的組織的需求。

--- 段落 57 (416 字元) ---
That, in fact, coming out of some of the work that we had done in the  middle ‘60s on organizations, led to this proposal that all RAND studies have an  implementation section where the issue of how we would actually make something happen ought to be addressed.Since, practically speaking, no studies ever  had that, I guess Charlie Wolf coined a phrase for saying that was the “missing  chapter” in all the studies.

[翻譯]
事實上，在60年代中期我們做的一些組織相關工作中，我們提出了一個建議，即所有蘭德研究都應該有一個實施部分，其中應該討論如何實際推動某些事情。由於實際上沒有一個研究曾經這樣做過，我想查理·沃爾夫創造了一個詞來說明這就是所有研究中的“遺失章節”。

--- 段落 58 (441 字元) ---
Also it seemed to me that very often the pattern was that the study would be  completed, and then the results would be briefed, but be very badly timed with  respect to the acceptability or responsiveness of the organization, and that actually RAND ought to set up a kind of sales department.That the strategy for RAND  ought to be that there ought to be people who focused on the customers and  exploited past work, no matter what its date.

[翻譯]
同時，我覺得很常見的情況是，研究會完成，然後結果會被簡報，但與組織的接受度或響應性非常不協調，而實際上蘭德公司應該建立一個類似銷售部門的組織。蘭德公司的策略應該是要有專注於客戶並利用過去工作成果的人員，無論其日期如何。

--- 段落 59 (275 字元) ---
Then, the opportunities for really  inserting the ideas arose.30  It also seemed to me, in my own experience, that letters and memos rather than  the study reports were much more effective than the kind of standard briefings,  the kind of rigmarole that usually went with it.

[翻譯]
然後，真正將這些想法融入其中的機會出現了。在我自己的經驗中，信件和備忘錄似乎比研究報告更加有效，比起標準的簡報和相應的瑣事。

--- 段落 60 (469 字元) ---
Anyway, I came into government with the view that the only way to really affect  things was probably either to be a close adviser of somebody who had sufficient  power to actually try to change things—but even then people overestimate what  even people who are supposed to be in charge can do—and that the alternative  was that you had to change people’s minds.And that you could do that, in part,  by changing the way in which they looked at problems, framed problems.

[翻譯]
無論如何，我加入政府是帶著這樣的看法，真正影響事情的唯一方法可能是成為某個擁有足夠權力實際改變事物的人的親密顧問，但即使如此，人們還是過高估計了即使是應該負責的人所能做到的事情；另一個選擇是改變人們的想法。你可以通過改變他們看待問題、提出問題的方式來做到這一點。

--- 段落 61 (354 字元) ---
Also,  I guess, through Herb Goldhamer I had come to appreciate the importance of  vocabulary in changes in that.All of this led to the choice with respect to this whole net assessment effort of diagnosis, not therapy, that immediately recommending what to do was not going  to work very well.Secondly, that people ought to think out their own solutions.

[翻譯]
此外，我猜，透過Herb Goldhamer，我已經開始欣賞詞彙在變革中的重要性。所有這一切都導致在整個網絡評估努力的選擇上，以診斷而非治療為主。立即建議應該做什麼不會工作得很好。其次，人們應該自己想出解決方案。

--- 段落 62 (181 字元) ---
Also, it’s worth mentioning that I had been struck by what happened to Alain  Enthoven [Assistant Secretary of Defense for Systems Analysis] and the whole systems analysis business.

[翻譯]
此外，值得一提的是，我對艾倫恩索文（國防系統分析助理秘書）和整個系統分析業務所發生的事情感到震驚。

--- 段落 63 (349 字元) ---
One of the ironies is that when the systems analysis stuff  was being thought through and argued through back in the ‘50s, I mean right  from the beginning, after considerable discussion the whole notion was that for  systems analysis, there was a class of issues that it could address and there were  larger, more important issues that it couldn’t.

[翻譯]
其中一個諷刺的地方是，當系統分析的內容在50年代被思考和辯論時，我指的是從一開始就經過充分討論之後，整個概念是對於系統分析來說，有一類問題可以處理，還有一些更大更重要的問題則無法處理。

--- 段落 64 (467 字元) ---
That, in particular, this notion of how  much was enough, or how much you ought to spend on, say, the strategic bombing effort, warfare thing was something that it couldn’t deal with.That people  basically had to assume that there were decisions that were going to be made on some much more general level of broad allocations and that the systems analysis  function was to, within already generally established budgets, to help in spending  it in cost-effective ways.

[翻譯]
特別是對於這個概念，究竟需要多少才足夠，或者應該花多少金錢在，比如說，戰略轟炸行動上，系統無法處理。人們基本上必須假設將在更廣泛的資源分配層面上做出決策，系統分析的功能是在已經設定的預算之內，幫助以成本效益的方式進行支出。

--- 段落 65 (491 字元) ---
31  When Enthoven came to record the history of his years in the Pentagon, as I say,  it’s very ironic that he should pick the title How Much Is Enough?for the book with  K.Wayne Smith, because that’s precisely what was decided, after long argument,  was not the kind of problem you could actually address.32 But I guess in response  to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara’s demands of whatever, or Enthoven’s  hubris, that’s where it ended up, trying to settle those kinds of questions.OK.

31 當恩索文來記錄他在五角大廈的歲月歷史時，正如我所說的，非常具有諷刺意味，他應該與K.韋恩·史密斯合著的書冊選擇了題為《多少才夠？》的書名，因為長時間爭論後，確實已經決定這不是一個你能真正解決的問題。32 但是我想作為對國防部長羅伯特·麥克納馬拉的要求或是恩索文的傲慢的回應，最終就是這樣，試圖解決這種問題。

32 但是我想作為對國防部長羅伯特·麥克納馬拉的要求或是恩索文的傲慢的回應，最終就是這樣，試圖解決這種問題。

So then let’s go to the beginning of September ‘69 through ‘72, which was this  period I was working for Kissinger.- Q2: This notion that notes and memos are more effective than briefings—how do  you square that with, I think, your notion that people don’t read anymore?I mean,  do you give them stuff and then…  
- Marshall: I don’t think they will read long reports.Well, some people obviously do.I  mean…  
- Q2: Harold Brown.- Marshall: …or Schlesinger.

[翻譯]
所以讓我們回到1969年至1972年初的九月份，那時我正在為基辛格工作。Q2：關於這個筆記和備忘錄比簡報更有效的概念，你如何能說得通，我記得你提到人們不再閱讀了？我的意思是，你會給他們資料然後… 
- 馬歇爾：我不認為他們會閱讀冗長的報告。當然，有些人顯然會。我是說… 
- Q2：哈羅德·布朗。 
- 馬歇爾：…或者施萊辛格。

But the ideal thing is probably to sit down and just talk to  them.But I think that sending them a letter that’s fairly short and makes the simple  points and so on, and is tailored to the occasion, to some problem they might have  and so on, is just a hell of a lot better than some report that comes in the door.- Q4: I am most intrigued by the consumer focus here.Your point that you almost do  studies, you stockpile them and then you wait until the opportunity is there to do  something useful.

[翻譯]
但最理想的事情可能是坐下來與他們聊天。但我認為，寄一封相當簡短並且表達了簡單要點、並且根據情況、對他們可能有的一些問題等，比從門口送來的某些報告要好得多。 我對這裡的消費者焦點感到非常好奇。你提到你幾乎做研究，你儲存它們，然後等到有機會做些有用的事情。

--- 段落 68 (309 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, you may brief them at the time for whatever good that is, but yes.So that what a place like RAND tends to offer is all of the past studies, not just the  one which is just coming off the press.- Q4: I don’t want to get you off the path of your book, so let me just put a topic on  the table.

[翻譯]
Marshall: 好吧，你可以在那時向他們簡報任何好處，但是是的。所以像蘭德這樣的地方通常提供的是所有過去的研究，而不僅僅是剛剛出版的那一個。- Q4: 我不想讓你偏離你的書的主題，所以讓我提出一個話題。

--- 段落 69 (456 字元) ---
I think that in this chapter it would probably be very useful to put a couple of paragraphs or a couple of pages to what was happening to the intelligence  organizations that you were starting to deal with at that point in time in their own  evolution.I mean now we are in the 1970s, we are 20 years in the agencies’ formation, you have senior managers who came from the old school, etc., etc., etc.- Marshall: Well, yes.We’ll get to that, I think, anyway.

[翻譯]
我認為在這一章中，把一兩段或一兩頁的內容放在當時您開始處理的情報機構的演變上可能非常有用。我的意思是現在我們身處70年代，機構成立已有20年，您有一些來自舊學校的資深經理等等。馬歇爾：是的，我想我們以後會談論到這個的。

--- 段落 70 (241 字元) ---
- Q4: Because it influences both how you affect them and how effective they were  able to…  
- Marshall: Well, as you know, I think the CIA of the ‘50s and early ‘60s is very, very  different from the ‘70s, much to the discredit of the ‘70s.

[翻譯]
Q4：因為它影響了你如何影響他們以及他們能有多有效...

Marshall：嗯，正如你所知，我認為五十年代和六十年代初期的中央情報局與七十年代非常不同，這對七十年代是一種不光彩。

--- 段落 71 (371 字元) ---
- Q4: You could raise a broader issue that whenever you have a new organization,  CIA, you saw it at a certain time, in other…you get these particularly high-quality  people and then they gradually… 
- Marshall: And I think I mentioned that Bross himself was very concerned about  that.I remember him talking to me, talking on the people he already saw in the  late ‘60s.

[翻譯]
問題四：您可以提出一個更廣泛的問題，每當您有一個新的組織，比如 CIA，您會在某個特定時間看到它，然後逐漸出現這些特別高素質的人才...
Marshall：我認為我提到了布羅斯本人對此非常擔心。我記得他與我交談，談論他在60年代末已經看到的人。

--- 段落 72 (472 字元) ---
His view was that these people didn’t know anybody else but people in  this agency, and that the people who originally formed it or who were recruited  in the ‘50s, throughout the ‘50s, had a lot of other associations, they knew other  people in the United States and elsewhere.By the late ‘60s, you had the effect of  this career design choice that the Agency made of trying, for security reasons, to  take people right out of universities and have a one-career lifetime.

[翻譯]
他的觀點是，這些人除了這個機構的人之外，不認識其他人，最初組建它的人或在50年代中被招募的人，在整個50年代，有許多其他聯繫，他們認識其他美國和其他地方的人。到了60年代末，你會看到機構為了安全原因做出的這個職業設計選擇的影響，即試圖從大學直接聘請人員，並讓他們在這個機構一生只有一個職業。

--- 段落 73 (433 字元) ---
There were  people that spent their whole time in there.The result is that they don’t know  anybody else, I mean in the truly professional way, lack breadth of experience,  and so on, contacts.OK.So let’s start in September of ‘69.The reason I start the thing there is that in  September ‘69, just before I was going to go off on a long trip to Europe with my  wife Mary, Kissinger called up and said he wanted me to come to see him.

[翻譯]
有些人在那裡度過了他們的全部時間。結果是，他們不認識其他人，我的意思是在真正的專業方面，缺乏經驗廣度等等聯繫。好。所以讓我們從1969 年9 月開始。我之所以在那個時候開始這件事，是因為在1969 年9 月，就在我準備和我的妻子瑪麗一起去歐洲長途旅行之前，基辛格打電話給我，說他想要我去見他。

--- 段落 74 (454 字元) ---
I went  to see him on my way to Europe, I stopped in Washington a couple days and it  was then that he told me that he wanted me to come and do what was then, he  thought, a two-month study to look at the flow of intelligence into the White  House.He wanted that done because President Richard Nixon was extremely  dissatisfied with the intelligence coming into the White House.Henry himself was  very, very negative in the way he talked about the thing.

[翻譯]
我在去歐洲的路上去見他，停留在華盛頓幾天後，他告訴我他希望我來做當時他認為是兩個月的研究，來研究情報流入白宮的情況。他之所以要這樣做是因為理查德·尼克松總統對流入白宮的情報非常不滿。亨利本人在談到這件事的時候非常消極。

--- 段落 75 (495 字元) ---
33 Evidently, fairly early in  the Administration, Nixon and Attorney General John Mitchell had taken some of  the early National Intelligence Estimates and read them closely, and thought they  were abominable in terms of the writing, the logic, everything.Henry also was  very down on the political analyses.He thought it was worse than that available  in the newspapers, which was lousy.So I agreed to do that, but told him I was  going on this vacation, and…[gap for tape change]  I did that.

[翻譯]
33 顯然，在尼克森政府早期，尼克森和司法部長約翰·米切爾曾經細讀過一些早期的國家情報估計報告，認為它們在寫作、邏輯等方面都令人厭惡。亨利也對政治分析非常不滿意。他認為這比報紙上的分析還糟糕。因此，我同意做這件事，但告訴他我要去度假，然後... [暫停更換錄音帶] 我完成了這項工作。

--- 段落 76 (464 字元) ---
The pattern of my life at that point was that at least every couple of  years, I would go to France, spend six weeks touring around, having a good time.So I probably didn’t get back until late in October.And I had these other responsibilities at RAND.I got a couple of nagging phone calls from Al Haig, Kissinger’s  military assistant, asking when was I going to show up and so on.I finally did  show up, and that was essentially the first week in December of ‘69.

[翻譯]
那時我的生活模式是至少每隔幾年一次，我會前往法國，花六個星期遊覽，度過愉快的時光。所以我可能直到十月底才回來。我在蘭德公司還有其他責任。我接到了海格少將的幾通煩人的電話，他是基辛格的軍事助手，詢問我什麼時候會到現場之類的。最後我終於去了，那基本上是在一九六九年十二月的第一周。

--- 段落 77 (313 字元) ---
I had a long discussion with Kissinger and it was decided that I would do two  studies.One was this study he originally talked about, which was on the flow of  intelligence into the White House—Where did it come from?How did people decide what they were going to send?What could be done to fix that and help that?

[翻譯]
我與基辛格進行了一次長時間的討論，最後決定我要做兩個研究。其中一個是他最初提到的關於情報流入白宮的研究 - 情報來自何處？人們是如何決定要發送什麼的？應該如何修復和改善這個情況？

--- 段落 78 (459 字元) ---
The second study was to be a kind of quality report card on intelligence, and after  some discussion, the area that was to be focused on, was that of the strategic  missile forces of the Russians.I began work on those.The only other thing that is worth mentioning is that in addition to that, I did a  third little study.While I was there—I was there from essentially the first part of  December through the first week of May of ‘70—a coup occurred in Panama.

[翻譯]
第二項研究是智能的一種質量報告卡，經過一些討論後，決定專注研究的領域是俄羅斯的戰略導彈部隊。我開始進行這項研究。值得一提的是，除此之外，我還進行了第三個小研究。我在那段時間裡——從1970年12月初到5月初的第一週——巴拿馬發生了一場政變。

--- 段落 79 (431 字元) ---
One  of the things that happened immediately was that questions were asked about,  “Who the hell are these guys?What do we know about them?” The answer turned  out to be not a hell of a lot.So Kissinger wanted to know why was that, why didn’t they know more?What was the actual state of the biographic intelligence?So I  looked at that and indeed drafted a kind of guide book about what…you really  want to know about these people.

[翻譯]
有一件立即發生的事情是，所有人開始問，“這些家伙到底是誰？我們對他們了解多少？”結果發現其實了解得並不多。因此，基辛格想知道為什麼會這樣，為什麼他們不知道更多？生物情報的實際狀況是什麼？於是我查看了這一點，確實起草了一種關於...你真的想知道這些人的指南。

--- 段落 80 (443 字元) ---
I did read a bunch of things and they were  poor, unless you were thinking about entertaining these people and wanted to  know whether they like scotch or bourbon, and things like that.Not much information there.So I went to work on that thing, although I was also sidetracked on a couple of things,  like the Russians had just threatened the Chinese and I got involved with, you  know, “What do you think about that?What do we do?” and so on.

[翻譯]
我讀了一堆東西，它們都很貧乏，除非你想要娛樂這些人，並想知道他們喜歡蘇格蘭威士忌或波本酒之類的東西。信息不太多。所以我開始著手處理那件事，盡管我也被一些事情牽制，比如俄羅斯剛威脅中國，我也捲入其中，你知道，“你對此有什麼看法？我們該怎麼辦？”等等。

--- 段落 81 (413 字元) ---
34 At any rate…  
- Q2: Are you going to say a few words about your studies?- Marshall: Yes, right.What I did on the first one about the flow was, I went over to  the Situation Room, which was the focal point for stuff coming in, to find out,  Where did the stuff come from?Then I went and found out, but through interviewing people, talking with them, how each of the organizations decided what  they would send.

[翻譯]
無論如何...
- Q2: 你會談談你的研究嗎？- 馬歇爾：對，我會。我在第一個關於流程的部分中，我去了情況室，那是接收資訊的焦點，我想找出，這些資訊來自哪裡？然後我藉由訪問人們、與他們交談，找出每個組織如何決定要發送什麼。

--- 段落 82 (408 字元) ---
I suppose the most interesting part of that was, say, the contrast  between the National Security Agency and the CIA.NSA perhaps was favored  by the fact that traditionally the head of the Sit Room staff came from NSA, but  nonetheless, every couple of months, they sat down with that fellow and a couple  of other people, I guess, and went over what were the topics, the areas that  seemed of most interest.

[翻譯]
我認為最有趣的部分是，比如國家安全局和中央情報局之間的對比。NSA可能是因為傳統上指揮室的主管來自NSA而受到偏愛，但無論如何，每隔幾個月，他們會與那位主管和其他一些人坐在一起，討論最感興趣的話題和領域。

--- 段落 83 (417 字元) ---
Then internally they put out a kind of directive of, “These  are the topics of which material is most wanted,” and they changed it every  couple of months.CIA, in contrast, made no effort to ascertain the areas of most  interest, but, judged by what was in The New York Times to determine the topics.I don’t know whether they felt very alienated from this administration or what it  was, but they just made no effort.

[翻譯]
然後他們在內部發布了一種指令，指出“這些是最想要的材料主題”，每隔幾個月就會更改一次。相比之下，中央情報局（CIA）並未努力確定最感興趣的領域，而是根據《紐約時報》中的內容來確定主題。我不知道他們是否感到對這個政府感到非常疏遠，或者是什麼原因，但他們根本不付出努力。

--- 段落 84 (395 字元) ---
The other thing was that they had this product,  this President’s Daily…report…  
- Q2: Brief?PDB?We called it PDB.We called it President’s Daily Brief.- Marshall: Right, which they sent down every day.By the time I had arrived on the  scene, it was very clear that Nixon was not reading it.So the question was, ”Why  the hell are you guys sending it?And how do you decide what you put in there?

[翻譯]
另一件事是，他們有這個產品，這個總統每日報告...
- Q2: 簡報？PDB？我們稱之為PDB。我們稱之為總統每日簡報。- 馬歇爾：對的，他們每天都會發送這個簡報。當我抵達現場時，很明顯尼克松並沒有在閱讀它。所以問題是，“你們為什麼還在發送它？你們如何決定裡面要放什麼？

--- 段落 85 (469 字元) ---
”  So one of the things that I did was to read in the very early part… I got copies, for  like the first six months of the administration, of that document.Very quickly the  NSC staff had begun to generate a competing daily analysis.So I read all of those.Also, since Nixon was a person who, if he read anything, almost invariably made  marginal notes, you could tell that fairly quickly he had stopped reading the CIA  product and continued to read from the other one.

[翻譯]
因此，我做的一件事情是在非常早期... 在那份文件的首六個月裡，我取得了副本。很快，國家安全委員會的工作人員開始產生一份競爭性的每日分析。所以我也閱讀了所有這些。另外，尼克松是個幾乎總是在閱讀時寫邊注的人，你可以很快地看出他停止讀取 CIA 的產品並繼續閱讀另一份文件。

--- 段落 86 (423 字元) ---
I also did a statistical analysis  of the degree to which these two things covered the same topics.The NSC one  always had more topics, and the overlap between the two, where they covered  the same topics and so on, was only about 60 percent.It didn’t have so many  more that that’s the reason why there’s more.But at any rate, the point was that  CIA just was not customer-oriented at all.And they also refused to give up.

[翻譯]
我還對這兩個事物涵蓋相同主題的程度進行了統計分析。NSC的主題總是更多，兩者之間的重疊部分，它們涵蓋相同主題等等，僅約為60％。它沒有那麼多項目，這就是更多的原因。但無論如何，重點是CIA根本不以客戶為導向。而且他們也拒絕投降。

--- 段落 87 (401 字元) ---
They  understood that they weren’t being read, but it was seen as their premier product  and they weren’t going to give it up.35  
- Q2: Who was doing the NSC one, was it coming out of the Sit Room, or off the NSC staff?- Marshall: It came out of the NSC staff.I’m sure there were some Sit Room pieces, it  was assembled in the Sit Room, but it was prepared by the regional people just  from that one.

[翻譯]
他們了解到自己的文件沒有被認真閱讀，但這被視為他們的旗艦產品，他們不打算放棄。35
- Q2：是誰在進行這個NSC文件，是從Sit Room出來的，還是來自NSC工作人員？- 馬歇爾：這是來自NSC工作人員。我確定有一些Sit Room的元素，是在Sit Room集結的，但主要是由地區人員準備完成。

--- 段落 88 (308 字元) ---
- Q4: Did you try to do any similar sort of analysis of the flow of information going  from the Sit Room to NSA?- Marshall: No, no.So I wrote a report describing the whole thing to Kissinger.And, I  guess, I made a number of suggestions to him.But there wasn’t a hell of a lot that  could be done about that.

[翻譯]
問題四：你有嘗試過對從S室到NSA的信息流進行類似的分析嗎？- 馬歇爾：沒有，沒有。所以我寫了一份報告向基辛格描述整個情況。我猜我對他提出了一些建議。但這方面其實沒有太多可做的。

--- 段落 89 (471 字元) ---
I told him that as far as I could tell, whatever was there  was really arriving, and that the analysis was awfully poor, which he knew, and  that…  At any rate, I don’t remember that there was anything particularly striking that I  could recommend to him on the quality of the intelligence, which I looked at the  forces, went over what was available, gave it relatively low marks.Of course the  NIEs were part of that, it was not only the daily or weekly sort of things.

[翻譯]
我告訴他，據我所知，無論是什麼正在那裡真的已經到達了，而且分析非常貧乏，他知道這一點，無論如何，我不記得有什麼特別引人注目的事情，我可以向他推薦情報的質量，我查看了軍隊，審查了可用的內容，給了它相對低的評分。當然，NIEs 是其中的一部分，不僅僅是日常或每週的事情。

--- 段落 90 (482 字元) ---
I remember that one part of the report dealt with what seemed to me the decline of the  old key staff in the Office of National Estimates, which when it started out…  the whole notion of it was that it was to be made up of people largely from the  outside.It would be some people from the intelligence community that would  become parts of the Office of National Estimates, but that retired military guys,  or ambassadors, people from the business world, or academia would be in it.

[翻譯]
我記得報告中有一部分是關於我所認為的國家估計辦公室舊重要人員的衰落，當它剛開始時... 它的整個構想是由大部分外部人士組成。這些人可能來自情報界，成為國家估計辦公室的一部分，但退休的軍事人員，大使，來自商界或學術界的人也會在其中。

--- 段落 91 (381 字元) ---
By  the early ‘70s, ‘69, it had become the last stepping stage of retirement.People’s  careers would end within the CIA, not just within the community as a whole and  that it was enough.There was still like a general, maybe somebody from State,  but everybody else was really from CIA.So it had lost its original character, didn’t  on the whole do that great, I mean with analysis.

[翻譯]
到了七十年代初期，也就是六十九年，這已經成為退休的最後一個步驟。人們的職業生涯會在中情局結束，而不僅僅是在整個社會中結束，這就足夠了。雖然仍有一些像是一般的人，也許是來自國務院的人，但其他所有人實際上都是來自中情局。所以它失去了最初的特色，整體來說並不太理想，我指的是情報分析方面。

--- 段落 92 (441 字元) ---
36 And if Henry wanted to change  something, …the quality of things, I mean that’s one thing that needed to be  changed, focused on.The other thing that I suggested, which led to a follow-on study, was the notion of  picking some part of the Soviet missile program, and, in some sense, by spending  a lot of time directing and advising and so on, to get an exemplary study done.This led to this special study on the SS-9 and its antecedents.

[翻譯]
如果亨利想改變某些事情…物品的品質，我的意思是這是需要改變的一件事。我建議的另一件事是，在蘇聯導彈計劃中挑選某個部分，在某種程度上，通過花費大量時間指導和建議等方式，進行一項優秀的研究。這導致對SS-9及其前身進行了這項特別研究。

--- 段落 93 (467 字元) ---
The study was  aimed at trying to understand, “Why does this thing look the way it does?What’s  the whole history?What is the design bureau?” and so on, everything about  it.Also, there were some reasons to believe that the successive generations of  Soviet missiles had been designed to reduce the number of men involved in their  day-to-day functioning and so on.The objective was to do a study that was both  historical and had a bureaucratic cast to it and so on.

[翻譯]
這個研究旨在嘗試理解「這件事為什麼看起來這樣？整個歷史是什麼？設計局是什麼？」等等，關於它的一切。此外，有一些理由認為，蘇聯導彈的後續世代設計旨在減少參與其日常功能的人數等等。目標是進行一項同時具有歷史性和審批性的研究。

--- 段落 94 (493 字元) ---
That study was done and  turned out to be moderately good, not great, but…  
- Q2: And that was your study?I mean you did this study?- Marshall: No, I supervised it.After sending in the report in May, I agreed to do that.So then over the course of the next nine months to a year I supervised that.37  
- Q2: Who was the principal…was this just CIA or the whole intelligence community?- Marshall: This was CIA.- Q2: CIA.And can you say who the CIA person was that was working primarily on that?

[翻譯]
這項研究進行後結果表現尚算中等，並非極佳，但…
- Q2：這個研究是你做的？我的意思是你執行這項研究嗎？- 馬歇爾：不是，我是監督進行。在五月寄出報告後，我同意監督進行。接下來的九個月到一年時間，我在監督進行。37
- Q2：主要的人是誰…這只涉及 CIA 還是整個情報界？- 馬歇爾：這是 CIA。
- Q2：CIA。你能說出在這方面主要負責的是哪位 CIA 官員嗎？

--- 段落 95 (96 字元) ---
- Marshall: I don’t remember the names.There were some people…But it was a fairly  large effort.

[翻譯]
Marshall：我記不得他們的名字了。有一些人……但這是一個相當大的努力。

--- 段落 96 (463 字元) ---
Then what happened was, while I was continuing to do that, Kissinger in the  summer of ‘70, asked Wayne Smith, who had just come on board [indistinct]  taken Larry Lynn’s place—this is the Larry Lynn who went off to the University of  Chicago, who had been in Systems Analysis prior—to do a private, separate study  of program augmentations that might be undertaken if the Soviets misbehaved,  proved recalcitrant, and so on.So Smith assembled a group to do that.

[翻譯]
然後發生的是，在我繼續進行這項工作的同時，基辛格在1970年夏天詢問剛剛加入的韋恩·史密斯，取代了拉里·林恩的職位-這位拉里·林恩後來前往芝加哥大學，之前一直在系統分析領域工作-進行一項關於如果蘇聯表現不佳、固執等可能採取的計劃增補的私人獨立研究。因此，史密斯組織了一個小組來進行這項工作。

--- 段落 97 (495 字元) ---
That  group consisted of myself, Schlesinger, who was still at OMB, Bill Kaufmann, Fred  Hoffman, Charlie Herzfeld, and Larry Lynn, who was coming back and doing that.That’s the group that I remember.I think Herzfeld did some stuff on research  and development programs.Kaufmann, I think, did something on tactical forces.Hoffman did something, I think, on strategic forces.And as the general, broad  background to all of this, Schlesinger and I did what was, in effect, a first net  assessment.

[翻譯]
那個小組包括了我自己、仍在OMB工作的施萊辛格、比爾考夫曼、弗雷德霍夫曼、查理赫茲菲爾德和拉里林恩，他當時正要回來負責一些事務。這是我記得的小組。我想赫茲菲爾德應該在研究和發展計劃上做了一些事情。考夫曼應該是在戰術部隊方面有所貢獻。霍夫曼應該是在戰略部隊上做了一些事情。作為所有這些的一個廣泛背景，施萊辛格和我實際上進行了第一次綜合評估。

--- 段落 98 (482 字元) ---
Herzfeld very much argued that we should do that.That is, give the  broad background of, here’s what the situation with respect to military balances are, here you have the long-term trends, and so on.Actually, I did most of it  because Schlesinger really didn’t have the time to do that.Let me mention one thing going back.When I was writing up this thing on the  quality of the intelligence, a delegation of three people, whose names I can’t  remember, came to see me from Defense.

[翻譯]
Herzfeld非常主張我們應該這樣做。也就是說，提供廣泛的背景，這就是軍事平衡的情況，這裡有長期趨勢等等。事實上，我大部分的時間都在做這個，因為施萊辛格真的沒有時間去做。讓我提一件事回來。當我在撰寫關於情報質量的報告時，有三個我記不起名字的國防代表前來見我。

--- 段落 99 (374 字元) ---
These were people who were on the  staff of this Blue Ribbon Panel.They were in the midst of an argument which they  finally resolved in favor of recommending this creation of the net assessment  activity in Defense that was to report directly to the Secretary.38 That was made to  Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird in the summer of ‘70, but he never did anything  about it.

[翻譯]
這些人是藍帶小組的工作人員，他們正在進行一場爭論，最終他們決定建議在國防部成立一個網絡評估活動，這個活動直接向部長匯報。這一建議在1970年夏天提交給了國防部長梅爾文·萊爾德，但他卻沒有採取任何行動。

--- 段落 100 (346 字元) ---
They came to lobby me to include in my recommendations to Kissinger  the reestablishment of the net assessment activity at the NSC, which I did not  include.39 It didn’t seem to me that it had to do with the quality-of-intelligence  issue.They had an argument for doing that, which was reasonable in some ways,  but anyway, I didn’t pick that up.

[翻譯]
他們來說服我，在我的建議中向基辛格提到重新在國家安全會議 (NSC) 建立網評活動，但我沒有包含這一點。這似乎和情報質量問題沒有關係。他們有一個做這樣的理由，在某種程度上是合理的，但無論如何，我沒有採納這一點。

--- 段落 101 (350 字元) ---
The idea of that came from a panel member who—I tracked back afterwards, and,  again, I can’t think of the guy’s name—had been the chief executive officer of  TRW.40 Anyway, he was on the Blue Ribbon Panel, and he was the person within  that whole committee that argued very much that what the Secretary of Defense  needed was a net assessment group.

[翻譯]
這個想法來自一位小組成員，後來我追溯了一下，但是，我想不起那位男士的名字——他曾是TRW的首席執行官。無論如何，他是藍帶小組成員之一，也是整個委員會中主張國防部長所需的是網絡評估小組的人。

--- 段落 102 (482 字元) ---
In fact, under his scheme of things, it was  a net assessment/strategic planning activity that on an organization chart was  drawn as a box to the side with a line directly to the Secretary.He believed that  what was needed was some way of pulling together some comprehensive picture  of what the state of affairs was and where things were going, what the biggest  issues were, and so on.As I say, I later had a talk with him in which I was trying to  understand what motivated him.

[翻譯]
事實上，在他的計劃中，這是一項網絡評估/戰略規劃活動，在組織圖上以一個方框的形式被畫在一側，並帶有一條直接指向部長的線。他認為需要一種方法將事態的全面情況和事物的發展方向整合在一起，了解最重要的問題等等。正如我所說，後來我和他談過一次，試圖理解他的動機。

--- 段落 103 (316 字元) ---
At any rate, I did this net assessment thing.In fact, I have a copy of it someplace here.- Q2: Did you call it that, “net assessment?”
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: Is it still classified?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: Getting about to the point where we might want to think about declassifying that.- Marshall: Well, I don’t know.

[翻譯]
無論如何，我做了這個網絡評估的事情。事實上，我在這裡某個地方有一份副本。- Q2：你就是這麼稱呼它為“網絡評估”嗎？
- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：它仍然是機密的嗎？
- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：或許該考慮解密那份文件了。
- 馬歇爾：嗯，我不知道。

--- 段落 104 (326 字元) ---
Again, this whole effort was done very quietly, as an  unadvertised thing privately for Kissinger, to provide him with initiatives that he  could, the way he put it, have in his hip pocket.- Q2: Well, you probably wouldn’t want to, or you may not want to declassify that  part, but the net assessment part in some sort of way.

[翻譯]
這整個努力是悄悄進行的，作為一個未公開的私人事情，是為了金斯利而進行的，目的是提供他自己能夠隨時使用的行動措施。Q2：嗯，你可能不想，或者可能不想解密那部分，但可以以某種方式進行淨評估部分。

- Marshall: One could look at it, but…  The next thing that happened, as we were just, I think, bringing this effort to a  close, because it started in the summer, was that in December of ‘70, Wayne Smith  reported that Nixon had met with Kissinger and George Shultz, who was then the  head of OMB, and kind of pointed at the both of them and said that he wanted a  study undertaken of the reform of the intelligence community, that he wanted to  make major changes and also wanted to cut the budget 25 percent.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我們可以看看，但…接下來發生的事情是，當我們快要完成這個努力時，因為它是在夏季開始的，華納·史密斯在1970年12月報告說，尼克森曾與基辛格和當時的OMB主管喬治·舒爾茲會面，並指著他們說他希望對情報界進行改革的研究，他希望進行重大改變並且想要削減預算25％。

--- 段落 106 (387 字元) ---
I heard later  that one of the things that happened was that he had, I guess while flying out of  Washington on Air Force One, flown over the CIA building and looked down and  saw those huge parking lots and said, “What in the hell are all these people doing?I don’t see anything coming out of this that’s worthwhile.” I don’t know that  that was the whole thing.There were many motives.

[翻譯]
我後來聽說，其中一件事是，我猜當他從華盛頓乘坐空軍一號飛出時，飛過了中央情報局大樓，往下看到那些巨大的停車場，然後說：“這些人在幹什麼呢？我看不到任何有價值的東西出來。”我不知道這是否是全部原因。毋庸置疑，還有許多動機。

--- 段落 107 (496 字元) ---
But at any rate, Shultz put  Schlesinger on this and Smith was asked by Kissinger to form up this effort that  was going to look at this thing.Smith didn’t have the time, so he asked me, when I’m still at RAND, to be Henry’s  guy on this thing.Of course Schlesinger owned this cell within OMB that followed  the intelligence community, and also had Bill Kaufmann working for him as a  consultant.So most of the work, or a good deal of at least pulling stuff together,  was done by the OMB people.

[翻譯]
無論如何，舒爾茨讓施萊辛格負責這件事情，史密斯被基辛格要求組建這個計劃，這個計劃將調查這件事。史密斯沒有時間，所以他讓我（當時我還在蘭德公司）成為亨利在這個計劃中的代表。當然，施萊辛格擁有OMB內的一個小組，負責跟踪情報社區，還有比爾·考夫曼為他工作。因此，大部分工作，或者至少是將東西整理在一起的工作，都是由OMB的人完成的。

--- 段落 108 (284 字元) ---
But they were so in the pocket of the intelligence  community that they didn’t in the end have much to contribute about what you  ought to do about these guys.There was an initial report in March of ‘71 and a final report in September, maybe  a little earlier, probably August of ‘71.

[翻譯]
但是他們對情報團體非常馴服，最後對於你應該如何處理這些人並沒有太多貢獻。最初的報告是在1971年3月，最終報告是在1971年9月或更早，可能是在1971年8月左右。

--- 段落 109 (485 字元) ---
41 Then some decisions were made and, I  don’t know who did some initial drafting, but in any case, in the middle of September, I undertook to draft the final kind of decision memoranda, the letters and  memos to Helms and to this one and to that one, Laird, etc.It all ended in being issued in early November of ‘71.42 Schlesinger by this time  was off at the Atomic Energy Commission.So I wrote the thing and then Haig and  Smith brokered it around, just to see it got acceptability.

[翻譯]
41之後做了一些決定，我不知道誰做了一些初步起草，但無論如何，到了九月中旬，我開始起草最終的決定備忘錄，給Helms、給這個人、給那個人、Laird等等的信件和備忘錄。最終在1971年11月初發布。

42此時舒勒辛格已經去了原子能委員會。所以我寫了這個東西，然後Haig和史密斯四處透過，只是為了確保它被接受。

--- 段落 110 (450 字元) ---
It was they, somehow,  who inserted a couple of paragraphs about this establishment of a net assessment activity at the NSC and started to lobby me to take that, which I did in January [April] of ‘72.I talked to… well, Bross had been replaced by Bronson Tweedy,  another Establishment figure, also from the clandestine services, who left and ran  the Audubon Society for a while.43 I talked to Tweedy and so I kept him informed as this study went on.

[翻譯]
一些人不知何故將有關在NSC建立網絡評估活動的幾段文字插入其中，並開始遊說我去參與，我於1972年1月[4月]參與了該活動。我與...Bross已被另一位來自秘密服務的建制派人士Bronson Tweedy取代，他曾經離開並在奧德邦學會擔任一段時間。我與Tweedy交談，並在進行這項研究時保持與他的聯繫。

--- 段落 111 (271 字元) ---
But it  became very clear that Helms really, wasn’t seeking any change, didn’t want the  added responsibilities that changes would entail, because under this thing, the  DCI was given a lot of new responsibilities, or old responsibilities which had never  been exercised.

[翻譯]
但很明顯的是，Helms實際上並非在尋求任何改變，也不想要由改變所帶來的額外責任，因為在這個事情下，中情局局長被賦予了許多新的責任，或以前從未執行過的責任。

--- 段落 112 (340 字元) ---
And the DCI was then given this Intelligence Community staff to  improve his ability to manage the whole budgeting and direction of the things…  
- Q4: Would it also be fair to say that Helms could see himself ending up in a fight  with the Secretary of Defense?44  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q4: Frequently non-political.- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
然後中央情報局局長（DCI）隨後獲得情報機構工作人員的協助，以提高他管理整個預算和事務方向的能力...
- 問題4:是否公正地說，赫爾姆斯可能會與國防部長發生衝突呢？
- 馬歇爾: 是的，沒錯。- 問題4:通常不會涉及政治問題。
- 馬歇爾: 沒錯。

--- 段落 113 (385 字元) ---
Finally, after spending a lot of time while still at RAND, half in, half  out of the government, I came to the NSC in January [April] of ‘72 for real as a  government official.- Q2: Now, did you report to Henry?- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: You directly reported to him?- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q2: Where were you located?Where was your office?- Marshall: In the Old Executive Office Building.

[翻譯]
最後，在RAND花了很多時間，一半在政府內，一半在政府外，我在1972年一月[四月]真正作為政府官員進入了NSC。- Q2：你是向亨利匯報的嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：你直接向他匯報？- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q2：你在哪里？你的辦公室在哪裡？- 馬歇爾：在舊行政大樓裡。

--- 段落 114 (476 字元) ---
In fact, initially, I had an office that  Admiral Robert Welander, the guy who was cashiered, well, anyway, kicked out of  the NSC because he had this naval enlisted man who had been…  
- Q2: Reporting stuff back to Admiral Tom Moorer in the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman’s  office.- Marshall: Yes, right, right.Then I changed, exchanged offices with John Lehman,  who was down in, I forget our final number, but it was like the third floor, like 304  or something like that.

[翻譯]
事實上，一開始我有一個辦公室，那個被革職的海軍上將羅伯特·威蘭德，不管怎樣，被踢出國家安全委員會，因為他有個海軍軍官，他一直在向聯合參謀會主席湯姆·摩爾上將辦公室匯報情況。- 馬歇爾：是的，對，對。後來我跟約翰·萊曼交換了辦公室，他在我們最後的號碼，我忘記了是第三樓，像是 304 號之類的。

--- 段落 115 (496 字元) ---
- Q4: This was originally meant to be a temporary assignment for you, you were  going to be here for just a couple of years.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q4: And you find yourself getting ensnared in the Washington scene.- Marshall: Yes.- Q4: How you managed to maintain your sort of “terrorist” role of upsetting large  bureaucracies over a period of a number of years.So maybe we could explore this  in this book.Or maybe your friends and associates would like to explore it.- Marshall: Yes, yes.OK.

[翻譯]
Q4：這原本是打算供你作為一項臨時任務，你只打算在這裡待幾年而已。- 馬歇爾：是的，對。- Q4：而你發現自己被捲入華盛頓的圈子中。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q4：你是如何成功地在多年的過程中保持你那種「恐怖份子」的角色，擾亂大型官僚機構的。也許我們可以在這本書中探討這個問題。或者也許是你的朋友和同事們想要探討這個問題。- 馬歇爾：是的，是的。好吧。

--- 段落 116 (404 字元) ---
So I came on board and it was just me initially.Then I got a secretary via NSA, Carol Doheny, and then Lexi Crow, and then I recruited Chip Pickett,  and then later Robin Pirie, Joan Hunerwadel.So there were, I guess, just six of us.- Q4: Actually, it was just five, because Carol left.Pickett arrived in early July, and Carol  was not there [indistinct].- Marshall: We really had two kinds of functions.

[翻譯]
所以我起初是一個人進來，然後我通過NSA獲得了一個秘書，卡羅爾·多赫尼，然後是萊克西·克劉，然後我招募了奇普·皮克特，後來還有羅賓·皮里，琼·胡內瓦。所以我們一共只有六個人，我想。實際上，只有五個人，因為卡羅爾離開了。皮克特在七月初到達，而卡羅爾不在（不清楚）。我們真的有兩種不同的職能。

--- 段落 117 (422 字元) ---
One of which, on the intelligence  side, really took up by far the most time, because while the thing was called the  Net Assessment Group, I think the reason the thing was created was they wanted  someone to monitor this implementation of this intelligence reorganization.Also,  this reorganization had created an NSC Intelligence Committee that Henry was to  chair, and he needed somebody to staff that and to work that.

[翻譯]
其中一項工作，依資訊方面的工作，實際上花費了最多時間，因為雖然這個工作被稱為網絡評估組，我認為創建這個工作的原因是因為他們想要有人監督情報重組的實施。此外，這個重組還建立了一個由亨利擔任主席的NSC情報委員會，他需要有人來協助管理並工作。

--- 段落 118 (334 字元) ---
And then we were to start up this net assessment function, which turned out to  be difficult, because while Laird had never done anything about this summer  1970 recommendation that he create a net assessment activity, the morning after  this memo came out from Nixon, he created a Director of Net Assessment, who  was given no staff.

[翻譯]
接著我們要啟動這個網路評估功能，但這證明是困難的，因為雖然勞德從未採取任何行動來應對1970年夏天他創建網路評估活動的建議，但尼克森發出這份備忘錄的次日，他便任命了一位網路評估主管，這位主管卻沒有任何工作人員。

--- 段落 119 (342 字元) ---
Wikner was appointed to it, and the whole idea was that he, in  that role, was part of the Secretary’s own office staff, and that task forces would  be set up and there would be no permanent staff of any sort, it would just be ad  hoc’d and so on.In fact, as far as I know, they did absolutely nothing; I mean they  didn’t do any assessments.

[翻譯]
Wikner被任命為該職位，整個想法是他在這個角色中，是秘書辦公室的一部分，並且會成立工作小組，不會有任何永久性工作人員，只會是臨時組成的。事實上，據我所知，他們什麼事情都沒做；我的意思是他們沒有做任何評估。

--- 段落 120 (492 字元) ---
The one thing that got started, in fact—I guess by  then Wikner had left—was done, not in the Secretary’s office, but under this Net  Technical Assessment group.Another thing I would mention is, why did I choose Chip Pickett, or how did I  have that happen?Well…In the first place, my notion was, what is the nature of  the problem here?It is to have these organizations change, and therefore I want  somebody who is interested in management, organizations, how to make them  function better.

[翻譯]
事實上，一開始進展的一件事——我猜當時Wikner已離開——並非在秘書辦公室進行，而是在這個網路技術評估小組進行。我想要提到的另一件事是，為什麼我選擇了Chip Pickett，或者這是如何發生的？嗯...首先，我的想法是，這裡的問題是什麼？它是使這些組織改變，因此我想要一個對管理、組織和如何讓它們更有效運作感興趣的人。

--- 段落 121 (494 字元) ---
So I went to my friends in the Harvard Business School and said,  “Do you have any recommendations?” I talked to Joe Bower and I talked to C.Roland Christensen, who were the two people who I knew best.I had met Bower and then, through him, Christensen, and I had involved the  both of them in a special panel or group that I had put together, probably in ‘67,  when Ivan Selin was the head of Systems Analysis [Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense (Strategic Programs), OSD Systems Analysis].

[翻譯]
所以我去找我在哈佛商學院的朋友，問他們是否有任何建議？我和Joe Bower以及C.Roland Christensen談過，他們是我最熟悉的兩個人。我之前認識Bower，然後透過他認識了Christensen，我曾邀請他們兩人參與一個特別小組，可能是在1967年，當時Ivan Selin擔任系統分析主管（副助理國防部長（戰略計劃），OSD系統分析）。

--- 段落 122 (484 字元) ---
Selin had seen some of the  stuff that we had done on organizations of the Russians and so on, Russian military, and he wanted a special look at that.So I recruited Jim March, Christensen,  Bower, and myself to look at what did we really know about the Russian military  organizations, how it was put together, how they functioned.We met several  times in Washington and then wrote a report about what we felt was new, what  could be done in a war, and so on.45  
- Q2: When was that?

[翻譯]
Selin曾看過我們在俄羅斯組織和俄羅斯軍事方面所做的一些工作，他想要對此進行特別的研究。因此，我招募了Jim March、Christensen、Bower和我自己來研究我們對俄羅斯軍事組織真正了解多少，它是如何組織的，它是如何運作的。我們在華盛頓多次會面後，撰寫了一份報告，報告了我們認為的新情報以及在戰爭中可能採取的行動。這是在何時發生的呢？

--- 段落 123 (409 字元) ---
- Marshall: ‘67, I believe.I can’t remember whether Bower had any recommendation for the NSC Net  Assessment Group, but Christensen had two.One he mentioned, a person who  was already in Washington, who I think was in the government, but might want  some other position.I talked to him, he was a very engaging fellow, but really  wasn’t interested.He wanted to leave government and make some money and so  on.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：我相信是在1967年。我記不清博爾是否對國家安全委員會網絡評估小組有過任何推薦，但克里斯滕森提出了兩個。他提到了一個人，已經在華盛頓了，我想他在政府裡，但可能想要其他職位。我跟他談過，他是一個非常吸引人的傢伙，但其實並不感興趣。他想離開政府賺一些錢之類的。

--- 段落 124 (461 字元) ---
The second recommendation was George [Eds: “Chip”] Pickett, who had the  advantage of being in the Army, an intelligence officer already, who was about to  graduate from Harvard Business School, and who might be the first.So I talked to  George Pickett and decided I wanted George Pickett.So then, I guess the main thing to talk about… I mean, again, with so much of this  it’s hard to say that it has much to do with intellectual development.- Q2: What’s that?

[翻譯]
第二個推薦人是喬治（昵稱“Chip”）皮克特，他有一個優勢，就是已經是一名軍官、情報專員，即將從哈佛商學院畢業，而且可能會是第一個。所以我與喬治皮克特交談後決定要選擇他。我想主要要談談… 我是說，對於這種事情，要說它跟智力發展有多大關聯，真的很難說清楚。- Q2: 什麼意思？

--- 段落 125 (268 字元) ---
- Marshall: I mean if this is an intellectual history…  
- Q2: No, I think it is.I think it is a collection of people and why…  
- Marshall: No, no, I understand that.I understand.- Q4: Tell me another thing.I kind of like the shaping issue, sort of what was going on.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：我是說如果這是一個知識史…  
- Q2：不，我認為是的。我認為這是一個關於人們和為什麼……  
- 馬歇爾：不，不，我理解。我理解。 - Q4：告訴我另一件事。我有點喜歡塑造問題，有點像發生了什麼。

At that point in time Bower was teaching this course in business policy, and Bower,  who started out as— He wrote his dissertation on financial analysis and capital  investment in some industries, and what he did was find out that the bureaucratic  interpretation of that phenomena was better than a financial interpretation, and  wrote a book on it.The other thing is that he had the draft chapters from the  Essence of Decision, decision-making during the Cuban missile crisis.

[翻譯]
當時，鮑爾正在教授商業政策課程。鮑爾一開始研究財務分析和某些行業的資本投資，後來發現官僚解釋比財務解釋更好，因此寫了一本書。另一件事是，他有關於古巴飛彈危機期間決策製定的《決定的本質》草稿章節。

--- 段落 127 (274 字元) ---
46 And that  was assigned reading in his course.It turned out that the vast majority of the  students in the class really didn’t like those chapters.They didn’t find that it was  very relevant as a framework for analysis.There were some who were absolutely captivated by it.

[翻譯]
這是他課程中指定的閱讀內容。結果發現，課堂上絕大多數的學生並不喜歡那些章節。他們覺得這些內容並不太適合用來分析。當然也有些人對此深感著迷。

--- 段落 128 (447 字元) ---
So there really was sort of an accidental— The point is that,  even the business world at this point was beginning to capture and teach their  students the whole issue of how administrative behavior and what it meant, and  how one had to think about it, more than just simply [indistinct].- Marshall: Well, Bower had been one of the participants in that…  
- Q4: The Ernest May study.- Marshall: …the May Group that I talked about last time.Right.

[翻譯]
所以確實有一種意外的情況-重點是，即使在這一點上，商業界也開始捕捉並教導他們的學生管理行為的整個問題，以及這意味著什麼，以及如何去思考它，而不僅僅只是[不清晰的]。-馬歇爾：嗯，鮑爾曾是其中一位參與者...-問題4：厄尼斯特·梅的研究。-馬歇爾：...我上次提到的那個梅集團。是的。

--- 段落 129 (439 字元) ---
- Q2: You want to say a few words about why you picked Robin Pirie?How?- Marshall: I picked him, I guess, on the advice of Pat Parker, who had been in Systems Analysis with him and told me Pirie had come a cropper of the Admiral, I  guess, Hyman Rickover, and would be available.I interviewed him.I think it was  kind of Parker’s recommendation, early availability, and so on.- Q2: So he was still in the Navy then?- Marshall: Yes, oh yes.

[翻譯]
- Q2: 你想說幾句關於為什麼選擇羅賓·皮里的原因嗎？怎麼做到的？- 馬歇爾：我猜是在帕特·帕克的建議下選擇了他，帕克曾與他一起在系統分析方面工作，告訴我皮里曾在艦隊上遇到了困難，我猜是哈曼·瑞科弗將軍，他現在應該有空。我接見了他。我認為這更像是帕克的推薦，他的早日可用性等等。- Q2: 那時他還在海軍裡嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

--- 段落 130 (455 字元) ---
- Q2: I mean, he didn’t get out as a result of this problem with Rickover or anything?- Marshall: No, no.One of the things I found when I got to the NSC was that while  they said I could have so many people, it was also clear that I had to get some  people for free, which people like the two of them were.The other people…  
- Q4: They had to come out of your budget.- Marshall: …were on the payroll.- Q4: There’s another point that is sort of a subtext.

[翻譯]
- Q2：我的意思是，他不是因為與瑞克弗有問題才離職的嗎？- 馬歇爾：不，不是。當我到了NSC時，我發現一件事，他們說我可以擁有這麼多人，但也很清楚我必須得到一些免費的人，像他們兩個這樣的人。其他人…
- Q4：他們必須從你的預算中扣除。- 馬歇爾：…是在薪資單上。- Q4：還有一個默默存在的觀點。

You made a statement many times  in the past that when new intellectual disciplines are developed, they sort of are  formed and certainly begin to see their formation in groups, in academia.And if  the agencies were doing their job, what you would do would be to penetrate, and I don’t mean that in the negative sense, penetrate the academic community and  find out who was beginning to think about these subjects long before they were  written about.

[翻譯]
在過去的許多次中，您曾多次做出一個陳述，即當新的知識學科發展時，它們會在某種程度上形成，並確實開始在學術界中看到它們的形成。如果機構正在履行自己的工作，您應該做的是滲透，我不是指在負面意義上滲透學術界，找出在這些主題開始被撰寫之前就已經開始思考這些問題的人。

--- 段落 132 (426 字元) ---
And the issue of organizational behavior, administrative behavior  was one of those aspects.- Q2: Was there a specific problem that you saw putting Pirie on, the way you saw  putting Pickett kind of on this organizational…  
- Marshall: No.I thought that Pirie would be the person who would spend most of  his time on the assessment activity, while Pickett and I would be the main people  working on the intelligence business.

[翻譯]
組織行為和行政行為的問題是其中一個方面。問題二：您是否看到將皮里放在這個組織上時出現了特定問題？- 馬歇爾：沒有。我認為皮里將會花大部分時間在評估活動上，而皮克特和我會是主要從事情報業務的人。

--- 段落 133 (376 字元) ---
Then, as I have already mentioned, the net  assessment thing took a long time to germinate, because we had to just overcome  a lot of bureaucratic obstacles, because Laird just didn’t want to do anything to  cooperate in any way.I think the most interesting stuff that came out of the work  that Pickett and I were doing was in connection with this NSC Intelligence Committee.

[翻譯]
然後，正如我已經提到的，評估網絡的事情花了很長時間才萌芽，因為我們必須克服許多官僚障礙，因為萊爾德根本就不想以任何方式合作。我認為皮凱特和我進行的工作中最有趣的是與國家安全委員會情報委員會有關的事情。

--- 段落 134 (389 字元) ---
One of its functions was to provide feedback and appraisal of the performance of the intelligence community in meeting the requirements of the top-level people.So we undertook several case studies, one set of which had dealt with  crises that had occurred, for which we were trying to understand the adequacy of  the intelligence community support to decision-makers in the crisis periods.

[翻譯]
其中之一的功能是提供情報社區在滿足高層人員需求方面表現的反饋和評估。因此，我們進行了幾個案例研究，其中一組案例涉及發生的危機，我們試圖了解情報社區在危機時期支持決策者的適當性。

--- 段落 135 (453 字元) ---
Out  of that came one of the biggest lessons I felt that I learned, which was that when  we set these task forces to work to look over the past—Chip kind of shepherded  most of these, we put them to work under somebody—the first version of the  report always was, “All things considered, the intelligence community…”  
- Q2: …did a damn good job.- Marshall: Yes, right.Then you had to go back and forth and finally you learn that  things weren’t so hot.

[翻譯]
在這過程中，我覺得學到了一個最重要的教訓，那就是當我們組成這些工作小組來審視過去時－Chip在其中扮演了引導的角色，我們讓他們在某個人的監督下工作－報告的第一個版本總是，“綜合考慮，情報機構…”
問題二：…做得非常出色。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。然後你必須來回查看，最終你會發現事情並沒有那麼順利。

--- 段落 136 (314 字元) ---
I just came away with the feeling that there was an enormous gulf that separated the people in the intelligence community from the  top-level people, certainly from Kissinger and Nixon.The two groups of people  had a totally different view of the world and what the nature of the crisis was,  what the stakes were.

[翻譯]
我只是感覺到，情報界的人與高層人士之間存在著一個巨大的鴻溝，當然是與基辛格和尼克松相隔。這兩組人有著完全不同的世界觀，對危機的本質和利害關係有著不同看法。

--- 段落 137 (470 字元) ---
And so, if you put these people to work to try to grade the  thing, they came up with these good grades, and it took some time for them to  even see that maybe things had not gone as well as they thought.Later, when  I used to give some talks to mid-term training sessions of the Agency people, I  used to tell them that I thought the situation was a little bit like: Here’s a chessboard, and there are a couple of players at the board, and they have a set of  advisers.

[翻譯]
因此，如果你讓這些人開始試著對事情做出評價，他們給出了高評分，但花了一些時間，才意識到事情可能沒有進展得像他們想的那樣順利。以後，當我在機構人員的中期培訓課程上發表演講時，我常告訴他們，我認為情況有點像這樣：這裡是一個棋盤，有兩個在棋盤前面下棋的玩家，以及一組顧問。

--- 段落 138 (112 字元) ---
The problem with the advisers is that they don’t know what the game is  about, what the moves of the pieces are.

[翻譯]
顧問的問題在於他們不知道這場遊戲是關於什麼，也不知道棋子的走步是什麼。

47  I think in several cases it was very clear that for Kissinger and Nixon, how things  came out mattered more than it did for some people who seemed to feel that  people are dying, we have to end this thing as soon as possible, almost any terms  will do; whereas people like Kissinger and Nixon saw crises as opportunities, as  well as problems that had arisen that had to be terminated as soon as possible.Also, they had goals, like U.S.

[翻譯]
在許多情況下，對基辛格和尼克松來說，事情的結果比對某些人來說更重要。某些人似乎認為人們正在死去，我們必須盡快結束這一切，幾乎任何條件都可以；而像基辛格和尼克松這樣的人卻將危機視為機遇，以及必須盡快終止的問題產生了。此外，他們有目標，如美國。

prestige and so on, that these other people had very  little interest in, as far as I could see.There was even a case, I forget which of the  ones, probably the India-Pak crisis, or something like that, where the question was  asked, and the reply back from the CIA was so poor—in fact I talked to the CIA people later about it.

[翻譯]
聲望等等，這些其他人對此幾乎沒有興趣，就我所看到的而言。甚至有一個案例，我忘記是哪一個，可能是印巴危機，或類似的情況，當時提出了問題，而中央情報局的答覆非常糟糕—事實上，後來我和中央情報局的人談過這個問題。

--- 段落 141 (372 字元) ---
Whereas people like Nixon and Kissinger cared a lot about  the details of the outcome and worried about long-term consequences, these  other people thought there were no long-term consequences, so that the question that had been posed was one that their response didn’t answer at all.So you  just have this difference that has to be taken account of and maybe you correct.

[翻譯]
尼克松和基辛格等人非常關心結果的細節，並擔心長遠後果，而這些其他人則認為沒有長遠後果，因此他們的回應根本沒有回答所提出的問題。因此，這種差異必須被考慮並可能被糾正。

The other thing I remember was we took a look at Yugoslavia, to look at the political and economic analysis, and convened a set of people.I remember Nathan  Leites was involved in looking at some of it, and I got Joe Kircheimer involved in  comparing the analysis of the Wall Street banks with the intelligence community’s  analyses.Nathan’s view, I remember, was, “Why don’t they translate and circulate  the best articles from German and Swiss newspapers?They’re much better than  anything they do.

[翻譯]
我記得的另一件事是我們看了一下南斯拉夫，進行政治和經濟分析，並召集了一群人。我記得內森·萊特斯參與了一些工作，我讓喬·基爾克海默參與了比較華爾街銀行的分析與情報單位的分析。我記得內森的觀點是：“為什麼他們不翻譯和傳播德國和瑞士報紙的最好文章？它們比他們所做的任何事情都好。”

” On the economic side, the comparison was very much to the  detriment of the intelligence community.48 Again, you come away with the view  that there is just a lot of expertise and knowledge out in the world, and a lot of it  is better, more relevant than stuff these guys produce.And they ought to be in  the business of mining that more than they are.Then we had the great good fortune that while we were there at the NSC we had  another big crisis.The Yom Kippur War occurred.

[翻譯]
在經濟方面，這種比較對情報機構非常不利。再一次，你會認為世界上有許多專業知識，而其中很多比這些人生產的東西更好、更相關。他們應該更多地從中探勘知識。在國家安全會議期間，我們非常幸運地面臨另一場重大危機，就是十月攻擊戰。

One of the things that we had  found when we tried to find out, in fact, what various estimates people had even  read, or taken any account of, in doing the earlier cases— When the war started,  I set Pickett to work, and he started interviewing people while the war was going  on, to try to understand the relationship, and the performance of the intelligence  community.Pickett wrote a very thick, really terrific study.

[翻譯]
當我們試圖查明人們讀過或考慮過的各種估計時，我們發現了一件事—當戰爭爆發時，我讓皮凱特開始進行調查，並在戰爭期間開始訪問人們，以了解情報機構的關係和表現。皮凱特寫了一份非常厚的，真正出色的研究。

--- 段落 145 (456 字元) ---
I think two copies were  sent out, one to Kissinger, who was then at State, and one to Schlesinger over at  the Defense Department.I have no idea what has ever happened to any of those.- Q4: The Net Assessment staff were, however, banned from talking to the Defense  Intelligence Agency.- Marshall: Yeah.Right.- Q4: Interesting set of stories there.- Q2: Did you keep a copy?- Marshall: I don’t know, we had a copy for a while.I don’t know where it is now.

[翻譯]
我想有兩份副本被寄出，一份寄給當時在國務院的基辛格，另一份寄給國防部的施萊辛格。我不知道這些文件最後發生了什麼事情。- Q4: 然而，戰略評估辦公室被禁止與國防情報局交談。- 馬歇爾：對，是的。- Q4: 這裡有一組有趣的故事。- Q2: 你有留一份副本嗎？- 馬歇爾：我不知道，我們曾有一份副本一段時間，但現在不知道它在哪裡。

--- 段落 146 (467 字元) ---
The thing to comment about is the reactions of the Agency during this period.When I first came on board, Edward Proctor [Deputy Director for Intelligence] and  others came down, pledging great cooperation, support, and everything, which  quickly evaporated, I would say.Had a very, very poor response.It was kind of  like my final disenchantment with these people, my feeling of how badly they  compared, I think, to people that were there in the ‘50s and early ‘60s.

[翻譯]
值得評論的是機構在這段時間內的反應。當我第一次加入時，愛德華·普羅克特（情報副主任）和其他人來了，承諾很好的合作、支持和一切，但很快就消散了，我會這麼說。他們的反應非常差。這讓我對這些人最終感到失望，感覺到他們和50年代和60年代初期的人相比有多糟糕。

--- 段落 147 (408 字元) ---
Often the  failures were just so obvious, but they never seemed to learn.I remember one of the first things that happened when I was there, and I think it  happened prior to Pickett’s arrival, was that Kissinger had asked for a special study  on the Chinese missile program, to make doubly sure that we really understood  the Chinese missile program.There came back a report which said, “Everything is  fine.

[翻譯]
這些失敗常常是如此明顯，但他們似乎從未學到教訓。我記得我在那裡的第一件事情之一，我認為發生在皮凱特抵達之前，就是基辛格要求進行一項關於中國導彈計畫的特別研究，以確保我們真正了解中國的導彈計畫。報告回來說，“一切正常”。

--- 段落 148 (391 字元) ---
We have multiple satellites up already, and when we get a new one up it’s going to even be better.And we, with high confidence, can tell you that they  don’t have any missiles, yet.” A few months later, it became clear they had missiles,  that we had been missing them.In fact, one of the reasons given for why we were  sure they didn’t have them was precisely the reason we had missed them.

[翻譯]
我們已經有多個衛星上軌道，當我們再發射一顆新的衛星時，將會變得更好。我們非常自信地告訴你，他們還沒有任何導彈。”幾個月後，我們發現他們其實已經擁有導彈，而我們卻一直忽略這一點。事實上，我們之前確定他們沒有導彈的其中一個原因，正是我們忽略的原因。

--- 段落 149 (470 字元) ---
The  reason for absolute surety was that with both we and the Russians, the people  who supposedly know the only way to do things, you have these things where  you have versions of the way you’re going to deploy them at the test sites, and  then you see exactly what they look like, I mean the silos or this or whatever,  the launching pads and so on, and then you are able to look and find them  when they start deploying.Nonsense.That’s not the way the Chinese did it.

[翻譯]
絕對確定的原因是，無論是我們還是俄羅斯人，那些據稱知道事情唯一正確方式的人，他們所提供的部署方案，在測試網站上看起來如何，包括發射井或發射台等，你能夠看到它們的真實樣貌，然後當它們開始部署時，你也能找到它們。這完全荒謬。中國人並不是這樣做的。

--- 段落 150 (330 字元) ---
They  obviously from the beginning had put a lot of emphasis on not being detected  very easily.So some evidence appeared, as I say, a few months afterwards which  showed they had them.Then when they went back, they were able to find them  four or five years earlier.And yet, it never teaches them anything, as far as I can  tell.

[翻譯]
從一開始，他們顯然非常強調不易被發現。所以，幾個月後出現了一些證據顯示他們擁有這些。當他們回去時，他們能找到他們早四、五年。然而，從我看來，這從來沒有教導他們任何事情。

--- 段落 151 (256 字元) ---
- Q4: This is the group that when the Arab-Israeli war breaks out in October, it got off  at about four o’clock on Saturday morning, at nine o’clock on Saturday morning  in the Pentagon the strategic warning staff meets, this is the [indistinct] operation.

[翻譯]
Q4：這是當阿拉伯以色列戰爭於十月爆發時，周六清晨大約四點下車的這個小組，在周六上午九點五分在五角大樓的戰略警告人員會面，這是[不清晰]行動。

--- 段落 152 (329 字元) ---
And they have a debate that goes on from nine until 11 or 12 o’clock in the  morning, and at that point they issued the DCI’s official position that this is not a  war, but simply a minor skirmish that is occurring and the Arabs and Israelis will  go away.But I think there is a theme that you want to sort of file away to raise.

[翻譯]
他們進行的辯論持續到上午九點至十一點或十二點，那時他們發表了DCI的官方立場，認為這不是一場戰爭，而只是一場發生的小衝突，阿拉伯人和以色列人將會離開。但我認為有一個主題你想要記下來討論。

--- 段落 153 (416 字元) ---
I think, maybe you disagree, there is this period between say 1967 and ‘69 on the one hand  and, say, 1975, where lots of sort of major institutional traumas take place to the  intelligence community, and I would guess probably the strongest period of sort  of shock change to the organization.One of which is Schlesinger becomes DCI.He’s the first outsider as the DCI.But then there’s a whole bunch of other things.

[翻譯]
我認為，也許你不同意，從六十七年到六十九年這段時期，與一九七五年相比，有許多重要的機構創傷發生在情報部門中，我想這可能是對組織產生最強烈震撼改變的時期之一。其中之一是施萊辛格成為中央情報局局長。他是第一位外來者擔任此職位。但還有一大堆其他事情。

--- 段落 154 (300 字元) ---
The failures in Vietnam intelligence and all the controversies…  
- Q2: The Church committees…  
- Q4: Two committees in the middle part of the ‘70s just absolutely blow apart the  insulation of the intelligence community from the Congress and permanently set  it aside.- Marshall: Yeah, yeah, right.

[翻譯]
越南情報的失敗和種種爭議…  
- Q2：教會委員會…  
- Q4：70年代中期的兩個委員會完全瓦解了情報機構與國會之間的隔絕，並永久地將其擱置。- 馬歇爾：是的，對。

--- 段落 155 (462 字元) ---
- Q4: And there are a bunch of things we can talk about…  
- Marshall: Well, again, obviously we can come back to this later, but the CIA was a  complete flop on the Soviet economic things, the defense burden, which was  something I’ll come back to a little later.Also indicative of the situation was that  Kissinger was very interested in one of the products they produced, which were  these psychological profiles that Jerry Post and some people out there did.

[翻譯]
Q4：我們可以談談許多事情...
Marshall：嗯，顯然我們可以稍後再回來討論這個問題，但中央情報局對蘇聯經濟事務、防禦負擔等方面完全失敗，這是我稍後會回來討論的一點。說明當時的情況還有一點就是，基辛格對其中一個產品非常感興趣，這些產品是傑瑞·波斯特等人製作的心理分析。

--- 段落 156 (298 字元) ---
49  They were seen by the rest of the intelligence establishment as sort of very low  products, I mean not our first-line estimates.And yet Kissinger very much wanted  them, valued them, and you had to have a big fight with them to get them to  really produce them, to do more than they were doing.

[翻譯]
他們被情報機構的其他人視為非常低端的產品，我指的不是我們的第一線估計。然而基辛格非常想要它們，重視它們，你必須和他們激烈爭執才能讓他們真正製作這些資料，超出他們當時的工作範圍。

--- 段落 157 (413 字元) ---
Another thing was that we wanted to get them to attach probabilities to their  predictions, first to give alternative outcomes, not just one outcome as a forecast,  and secondly, to attach probabilities.That was a great trauma for them and you  never succeeded in dealing with it.During this period, RAND had been doing  some work on a thing that’s technically called “reproducible [reproducing] scoring  systems.

[翻譯]
另一件事是，我們想要讓他們將概率附加到他們的預測中，首先是提供替代結果，而不僅僅是一個預測結果，第二是附加概率。這對他們造成了巨大的創傷，你從未成功地應對過這個問題。在這段時間裡，蘭德公司一直在做一個叫做“可重現[再現]評分系統”的技術工作。

--- 段落 158 (472 字元) ---
”50 It’s a way of assigning a score for how close you are to the right answer  that provides an incentive for someone supplying an estimate to provide, in fact,  his best estimate, not to play games with the receiver of the thing.They had developed a really neat device of multiple-answer questions with three answers.They  had developed it, as a demonstration, for a whole series of different fields, like  Roman history or 17th-century music, or various kinds of things.

[翻譯]
這是一種方式，用來將一個分數指定給你距離正確答案有多接近的程度。這樣一來，提供估計的人就有了一個誘因，他會竭盡所能提供他最佳的估計，而不是與接收方玩弄把戲。他們開發了一個非常聰明的裝置，可以提供三個答案的多重選擇題。作為示範，他們已經為一系列不同的領域開發了這個裝置，比如羅馬歷史或17世紀音樂，或者各種不同的事物。

--- 段落 159 (434 字元) ---
The virtue of it  with the three potential answers was that with a light pen you could register your  relative probabilities among the three by the point on this triangle, the area of  this triangle that you could get.If A, if you were 100 percent sure, you put it at…  Why don’t we get back to that, I guess.Alright, maybe we just ought to take that up,  the transition of Net Assessment from the NSC staff to the Defense Department.

[翻譯]
其中的優點是，你可以用一支輕筆在這個三角形上點出你對三個可能答案之間的相對機率，你可以獲得的這個三角形的面積。如果是A，如果你確定百分之百，你就把它放在... 我們為什麼不回到這個，我想。好吧，也許我們應該討論一下，Net Assessment從NSC工作人員轉到國防部的過渡。

--- 段落 160 (375 字元) ---
The  main thing to say about the transition, I think, would be that Kissinger in the summer  of ‘73 had been appointed the Secretary of State and had the two jobs, but he was  beginning to spend more and more of his time over at the State Department.I  guess this all happened at the same time that Schlesinger came to Defense.I guess  he actually arrived on the 2nd of July.

[翻譯]
我認為關於過渡的主要事情是，基辛格在1973年夏季被任命為國務卿，並擔任兩份工作，但他開始花越來越多的時間在國務院。我猜這一切都是在舒萊辛格來到國防部的同時發生的。我想他實際上是在7月2日抵達的。

--- 段落 161 (335 字元) ---
Fairly soon afterwards, he called me, and  called me every week or two about coming over and setting up a net assessment  office in Defense.I had been somewhat hesitant about doing that.In the first place,  I wasn’t sure I was going to stay in Washington—ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.Secondly, Mary  for various reasons was against it and so on.

[翻譯]
不久之後，他打電話給我，每隔一兩個星期就打一次關於來設立一個國防網絡評估辦公室的事情。我一開始對這件事有些猶豫。首先，我不確定自己是否會留在華盛頓 - 哈哈哈哈。其次，瑪麗出於各種原因都反對這個計劃等等。

--- 段落 162 (391 字元) ---
But then what happened was really  a negotiated deal with Kissinger to transfer the whole office, not just that I would  come over and start over again, but that the whole office and responsibility for  net assessment, national net assessments would be transferred with me to Defense.- Q2: Who negotiated that?- Marshall: Schlesinger and Kissinger between themselves.So that’s what happened.

[翻譯]
但接下來發生的是真的是與基辛格進行了談判的一項協議，將整個辦公室轉移，不僅僅是我來重新開始，而是整個辦公室和對國家淨評估的責任將與我一起轉移到國防部。- Q2: 誰進行了談判？- 馬歇爾：謝爾辛格和基辛格之間進行談判。這就是所發生的事情。

--- 段落 163 (168 字元) ---
In fact, someplace around here there probably is a National Security Study Memorandum that transfers the thing.- Q2: NSSM 186?- Marshall: No, no, there’s several NSSMs.

[翻譯]
事實上，這附近可能有一份轉移該物件的國家安全研究備忘錄。- Q2: NSSM 186？- 馬歇爾：不，不，有幾個NSSM。

--- 段落 164 (474 字元) ---
There’s a NSSM that sets up the NSC net  assessment process, which probably came out in the early part of ‘73, when we  finally reached agreement about how we were going to proceed with net assessments from that point on, which was that they would be formulated through  some process at the NSC level, with consultation and so on of the departments,  and then they would be assigned to some department to carry out, depending  on the character or focus that they would have.

[翻譯]
有一個NSSM建立了NSC網絡評估過程，這可能是在73年初時提出的，當時我們終於就從那時開始如何進行網絡評估達成了協議。根據協議，這些評估將通過某種NSC層面的流程制定，並在諮詢各部門等過程後，會分配給某個部門進行執行，根據其特徵或焦點的不同。

--- 段落 165 (475 字元) ---
So there was a NSSM on that.51  Then there was a NSSM, NSSM 186—that’s where Project 186 got its number—  which was the first net assessment that was to be done, which was on ground  forces.52 It wasn’t completed until I came over to the Defense Department, when  it was conducted or headed on the government side by Pat Parker, who went to  work for, I forget the name of that fellow who was hissuperior, who… 
- Q4: Not in Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence?

[翻譯]
所以關於這件事情有一個NSSM文件。然後又有一個NSSM，即NSSM 186 - 這就是186計劃編號的由來 - 這是第一個應進行的網絡評估，內容涉及陸地部隊。直到我加入國防部時，這個文件才得以完成，當時它由政府方面的帕特·帕克指導進行，他之後去了...- 問題4：不在指揮控制、通訊和情報領域嗎？

--- 段落 166 (406 字元) ---
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2 or Q4: Parker.- Marshall: Yeah.Then there’s another NSSM [NSDM—National Security Decision  Memorandum] which transfers responsibility.That’s later.To kind of sum up this  NSC period, I would say— Well, let me go back before doing that.One of the other things that happened, of course, in this period was that Schlesinger became the DCI.

[翻譯]
國防部情報助理部長？- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2或Q4：帕克。- 馬歇爾：對。然後有另一個轉移職責的NSSM [NSDM-國家安全決策文件]。那是稍後的事情。總結這個NSC時期，我想說- 好吧，讓我在總結之前回顧一下。當然，這段時期發生的另一件事情是舒萊辛格成為了中央情報局局長。

--- 段落 167 (450 字元) ---
I sent him a letter, handwritten, so I don’t have a copy of it, telling him what I thought the problems were that he was going to face.I remember  the opening sentence or two says, “You’re taking over an organization with very  low morale that compares unfavorably with the people in the ‘50s.” I made the  point that then they were very activist, sought outside help, worked long hours;  now it’s become a routine eight-to-five job for these people.

[翻譯]
我寄了一封手寫信給他，所以我沒有信的副本，信中告訴他我認為他將面臨的問題是什麼。我記得開頭的一兩句話是："你要接手一個士氣非常低落的組織，與五十年代的人們相比，這些人的情況並不理想。"我認為那時他們非常積極主動，尋求外部幫助，工作時間很長；現在對這些人來說，這只是一份例行的朝九晚五的工作。

--- 段落 168 (490 字元) ---
They seem uninterested in anybody else’s information or knowledge, and so on.Schlesinger later  told me, “You certainly were right about that.” He said, “You could get trampled on  the stairways at 4 o’clock.I don’t know why they put lights in this building.”  The other thing about Schlesinger, that was already mentioned, was that he was  the first DCI from outside of the Agency.Well, that’s not right.McCone had been  from the outside.- Q4: McCone?- Marshall: Yes, he was a businessman.

[翻譯]
他們似乎對其他人的信息或知識都不感興趣。之後舽金格告訴我，“你當時確實是對的。”他說，“在下午4點，在樓梯上可能會被踩踏。我不知道為什麼他們在這棟樓裡裝了燈。”另一件關於舽金格的事情，就像之前提到的，他是首位來自機構外的中央情報局局長。哦，這是不對的。麥康來自外部。- 問題4：麥康？- 馬歇爾：是的，他是一名商人。

--- 段落 169 (417 字元) ---
- Q4: But no intelligence experience in the war?- Marshall: No, I don’t think so.At any rate, Schlesinger just scared them.In fact, there  were a bunch of the middle managers, including Proctor, who just hid when he  was out there.It’s hard to know exactly why he was so frightened.- Q4: Well, his personality, as I recall, would lead one to feel that way.He did not tolerate fools, to put it mildly.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
- 問題4：但是在戰爭中沒有情報經驗嗎？- 馬歇爾：我不這麼認為。無論如何，施萊辛格只是嚇到了他們。事實上，包括普羅克特在內的許多中層經理在他出現時就躲起來了。很難確切地知道他為什麼那麼害怕。- 問題4：嗯，據我記憶，他的個性會讓人覺得那樣。可以說他根本不容忍愚蠢。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 170 (437 字元) ---
He did, of course, even before he went out there… Well, in the first  place, let me just mention another part of the story.He and I had been talking for  some time because, while he took over in, I think, February of ‘73, right after the  election in ‘72, Nixon went up to Camp David, and then called the various heads  of agencies up there.He called Helms and, at least second or third hand, told him  he was not going to be continuing.

[翻譯]
當然，他在出任前就這樣做了...嗯，在第一個地方，讓我提一下故事的另一部分。他和我已經談了一段時間了，因為當他在1973年2月接手時，就在1972年選舉之後，尼克松去了戴維斯營，然後叫各個機構的負責人過去。他叫赫爾姆斯，至少是第二或第三手消息告訴他，他不會繼續做下去。

--- 段落 171 (480 字元) ---
53 When Schlesinger came up there, to talk  about the Atomic Energy Commission, which he was head of, he was told that he  was going to take over.So he and I began talking right after that; this happened  right after Thanksgiving.In December, he and I started talking about what do you  do with this place, who are the good guys, and various things.54 As I say, I wrote  him this longish letter about the situation and things I thought that needed to  be done for long-term goals.

[翻譯]
當施萊辛格來到那裡，談論他所領導的原子能委員會時，他被告知他要接管這個職位。於是，在感恩節後不久，他和我開始交談；這發生在十二月。在十二月時，他和我開始討論這個地方應該怎麼做，誰是好人，以及其他各種事情。正如我所說，我寫了一封關於情況和我認為應該為長期目標做的事情的長信給他。

--- 段落 172 (180 字元) ---
Then when he initially took over, I started spending  weekends up there, meeting with him, helping him [indistinct].- Q2: Not literally the whole weekend?- Marshall: No, Saturdays.

[翻譯]
然後當他最初接任職務時，我開始花週末到那裡，與他見面，幫助他進行[不清楚的工作]。-Q2:不是整個週末嗎？-馬歇爾：不，只有星期六。

--- 段落 173 (376 字元) ---
Then later when he took over as SecDef, I again wrote him  something, and there’s a three-, or four-, or five-page thing that’s around, somehow that got typed up and there are copies around, about my perspective on…a  longer-term look at the world and where things had [indistinct], issues that he  ought to think about, and so on.55  To come back to this period from the NSC.

[翻譯]
後來當他擔任國防部長時，我又寫了一封信給他，大約是三、四、甚至五頁的長度，不知怎麼回事，這封信被打印了出來，有複本流傳，內容是我對世界的長期觀點和問題，他應該思考的事情等等。回想起從國家安全委員會回來的這段時間。

--- 段落 174 (328 字元) ---
The first thing I would say is my impression ended up that Kissinger, even going back to the initial studies he had me do  and then this monitoring of the reorganization of the intelligence community and  so on, that he fundamentally was not interested in all that.He was doing it, I think,  because Nixon wanted something done.

[翻譯]
我要說的第一件事是，我的印象最終是，基辛格即使回溯到他讓我做的最初研究，以及對情報界重新組織等方面的監控，基本上並不對這些感興趣。我認為他這樣做是因為尼克松想要完成某件事情。

--- 段落 175 (459 字元) ---
I think Kissinger thought the intelligence  products were terrible, but he is not someone who is at all focused on improving  organizations, changing organizations, making them better.His view, I think, of  the NSC was, “We can get what we want out of the intelligence organizations, for  the most part, so why do we care?” Schlesinger had a totally different view.Wherever he went he was very interested in the organization and changing or making  it better.

[翻譯]
我認為基辛格認為情報產品很糟糕，但他並不是一個專注於改善組織、改變組織、使其更好的人。我認為他對國家安全委員會的看法是，“我們可以從情報機構中得到我們想要的，所以我們為什麼要關心呢？”施萊辛格的觀點則完全不同。無論他走到哪裡，他都對組織很感興趣，並且致力於改變或使其更好。

--- 段落 176 (482 字元) ---
In fact, that may be one of the big distinctions among officials, one way of thinking about the people who come into government.That is, there are some people  who just want to do as well as they can during the couple of years they are there  and are interested in performing well, or seeming to perform well.But they are totally uninterested in the organizations or the processes.Then there’s a set of guys  who are really interested in trying to change things or make them better.

[翻譯]
事實上，這可能是官員之間的一個重要區別，一種思考進入政府的人們的方式。也就是說，有些人只是想在他們在那裡的幾年裡盡可能表現出色，對表現出色或看起來表現出色感興趣。但他們完全對組織或流程不感興趣。然後還有一群人真的很想試著改變事情或讓它們變得更好的人。

--- 段落 177 (495 字元) ---
The other thing is to look back at the performance of the intelligence community.Just really bad.Let me give you another example.I remember being called over  and going into the Situation Room.Then Carl Duckett [CIA Deputy Director for  Science and Technology] came down to break what was really bad news.In the  negotiations with the Russians, we had put a lot of emphasis with respect to the  SS-19, about what its size or volume could be and there were some specific provisions in the treaty.

[翻譯]
另一件事是回顧情報界的表現。實在很糟糕。讓我舉個例子。我記得被叫去到情勢室，然後卡爾·達克特（中央情報局科學技術副局長）下來傳達了一個真的很糟糕的消息。在與俄羅斯的談判中，我們對於SS-19洲際彈道飛彈，以及關於它的尺寸或容積都花了很多心思，條約中也有一些具體的條款。

--- 段落 178 (423 字元) ---
56 Those provisions had been guided by past Agency estimates  of what the volume or size of the SS-19 was.Duckett was there to tell us that the  calculations had been wrong.There was an error in them that had not been  detected for several years.It had been there for years.It was a simple thing of  some number had been divided by another number rather than the square root  of the number, or some damn thing of this sort.

[翻譯]
這些條款是根據過去機構對SS-19體積或大小的估算制定的。達克特在那裡告訴我們，這些計算是錯誤的。有一個錯誤在這些計算中多年來一直未被發現。這個錯誤存在多年了。這是一個簡單的事情，某個數字被另一個數字除以，而不是數字的平方根，或類似的某種東西。

--- 段落 179 (456 字元) ---
At any rate, the -19 was bigger,  very likely bigger, enough bigger that it would cross this threshold that was set  in the SALT I treaty.So if the Russians signed it as they probably did, or would, or  had—I can’t remember the date—they were already in violation of the thing, or  they were intending to violate it.I remember Haig and I and, I forget, there were a  couple of other people who were in there… I recall Haig being pretty upset about  it all.

[翻譯]
無論如何，-19更大，非常可能更大，足夠大以至於將突破SALT I條約中設定的門檻。因此，如果俄羅斯人簽署了它，他們很可能已經違反了這一條約，或者打算違反它。我記得海格和我，還有，我忘了，當時還有另外幾個人...我記得海格對此事感到非常沮喪。

--- 段落 180 (417 字元) ---
But again, it was just symptomatic that here’s this organization, probably the  TRW guys had made this mistake, nobody in the Agency had ever checked the  calculations or knew enough to check the calculations.Now, this in effect… not  real serious…  
- Q2: Does this relate to the SS-13, and that the -19 could only be so much bigger  than the -13 and there was an error on the size of the -13 or something like that?

[翻譯]
但再次強調，這僅僅是一個症狀，顯示出這個組織中，可能是TRW的人犯了這個錯誤，機構中沒有人曾檢查過這些計算或知道如何檢查這些計算。現在，這實際上不太嚴重...
- Q2：這是否與SS-13有關，-19只能比-13大這麼多，而對-13的尺寸有誤差之類的？

--- 段落 181 (484 字元) ---
- Marshall: No, this, as far as I remember it, was that we had an estimate of what the  -19 was, and the whole thing was an issue of trying to constrain…  
- Q2: You could only grow so much in volume.- Marshall: Yes, that’s right.The point was that it was already bigger than that.And  you had spent based on their estimates, had negotiated this set of constraints.- Q4: And we had it wrong.- Marshall: And we had it wrong.- Q4: Is this the -9 or the -19?- Marshall: No, it’s the -19.

[翻譯]
Marshall：不，就我記得的範圍而言，我們對-19的估計是這樣的，整個問題是試圖限制……  
Q2：你只能增長到一定程度。- Marshall：對，沒錯。重點是它已經比那更大了。根據他們的估計，你已經花費了，已經達成了這一系列限制。- Q4：但我們錯了。- Marshall：對，我們錯了。- Q4：這是-9還是-19？- Marshall：不是，這是-19。

--- 段落 182 (348 字元) ---
- Q4: It was how much it could grow depending upon whether they became big  missiles or small missiles.- Q2: This is a modernization issue and it had to do with the -19, which was not yet  deployed, but was coming down the road, and I think was a modernization to the  -13.- Marshall: Yeah, could be.- Q2: Then the issue was how much could it grow.

[翻譯]
問4：這取決於它發展成大型導彈還是小型導彈的程度。- 問2：這是一個現代化問題，與尚未部署但即將來臨的-19有關，我認為這是對-13的現代化。- 馬歇爾：是的，可能是這樣。- 問2：然後問題就是它可以增長多少。

--- 段落 183 (443 字元) ---
And there was this error in calculations that I had known about, I mean I didn’t know about this thing, there was  this error in calculation, but I had thought it was based upon our estimated size of  the -13 so that therefore the projected growth meant the -19 could be so big, but  we were wrong about the size of the -13, which meant that the -19 was going to  break the limit.- Marshall: It could be.My memory is not that good.It could be.

[翻譯]
在計算中有一個錯誤，我是指我不知道這件事，計算中出現了一個錯誤，但我當時認為這是基於我們對-13的預估大小，因此預計的增長意味著-19可以如此巨大，但我們對-13的大小估計是錯誤的，這意味著-19將突破限制。- 馬歇爾：有可能。我的記憶不太好。有可能。

- Q4: But the main point of it was that it was rotten arithmetic.- Marshall: Yeah, but the point was that it was one of these things where the arithmetic was wrong.And nobody had ever checked it; it had been around for several  years.- Q2: Now, Henry had one of those, too, where his arithmetic was wrong, on equivalent megatonnage, as I recall, because it’s the megatonnage to the two-thirds and  he was doing the square root and I don’t know where he got that from.- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
問題4：但其主要意義在於這是錯誤的算術。馬歇爾：是的，但重點是這是一個算術錯誤的情況。沒人檢查過它；它已經存在了幾年了。問題2：現在，亨利也有一個這樣的情況，他的算術錯了，我記得是等效百萬噸的問題，因為它是百萬噸的兩次方，他卻做平方根，我不知道他從哪裡得到這個想法。馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

--- 段落 185 (468 字元) ---
I guess one of the fun things about this period was the raising-of-the-Soviet submarine project.- Q4: Glomar Explorer.- Marshall: Yep.An interesting reflection: I talked with Schlesinger about it because  there was a set of issues about whether to go forward with it.57 And it goes back  to an idea, which we’ll maybe get into, of Schlesinger’s, and mine, too, this business of thinking about things you do in terms of their impact on other people,  on your opponents.

[翻譯]
我想這個時期有趣的事情之一是蘇聯潛艇項目的提升。- 問題4：格洛馬探險家。- 馬歇爾：是的。一個有趣的反思：我和施萊辛格交談過，因為是否繼續進行這個項目存在一系列問題。這又追溯到一個想法，也許我們可以深入探討，就是施萊辛格和我的，關於把你所做的事情想成對其他人、對你的對手有什麼影響的這種思維。

--- 段落 186 (485 字元) ---
His view was, yes, this is risky, but from time to time the U.S.should pull off some real exploit, just to shake up the other guy.- Q4: To keep them unbalanced.- Marshall: And this is sort of, therefore, the right kind of thing to do, not only for  its purported immediate payoffs that you get, but its perceptions, psychological  aspect of things.- Q4: Is this the period in which you were doing, they did the work on the anomalies,  the 56, the 58 anomalies, whatever we called them.

[翻譯]
他的觀點是，是的，這很冒險，但美國偶爾應該要進行一些真正的冒險行動，只為了讓對手感到震驚。- Q4：讓對手失去平衡。- 馬歇爾：因此，這是正確的做法，不僅是為了所謂的立即回報，還有心理層面的感知。- Q4：這是你們進行 anomalies、56年、58年的研究的時期嗎，無論我們稱它們為何。

--- 段落 187 (449 字元) ---
This is the things that the  Soviets are doing which we can’t find an adequate explanation for.- Marshall: Yes, I think that work was going on, and Herzfeld was much involved in  that kind of thing.Yeah, I think so.Anyway, the period, though, is kind of crazy, all this arms control nonsense going  on.When you see it up close and see how irrational it all is, and how subject it is  to these problems like this arithmetic about the size of the -19.

[翻譯]
這就是蘇聯正在做的事情，我們找不到合適的解釋。-馬歇爾：是的，我認為工作正在進行，赫茨菲爾德在那方面很參與。是的，我想是這樣。不管怎樣，那個時期有點瘋狂，所有這些軍備控制的無稽之談。當你近距離看到它，看到這一切是多麼的不理性，以及如何受到這些問題的影響，比如-19 這種規模的算術問題。

--- 段落 188 (431 字元) ---
And also, arms  control has the problem of controlling some dimensions of things that don’t have  any impact on anything at all.- Q2: Or have negative impact.- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q2: They just don’t figure out what they’re trying to fix.- Marshall: Right.No chance of [indistinct].- Q2: Like sausage.The more you see, the less…  
- Marshall: Right.Let’s talk a little bit about the Schlesinger period here and this transition.

[翻譯]
而且，軍備控制還存在一個問題，那就是控制一些與任何事物都沒有任何影響的維度。- Q2：或者具有負面影響。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q2：他們只是不知道他們想要修復什麼。- 馬歇爾：對。沒有機會[難以理解]。- Q2：就像腸衣。你看得越多，就越少...- 馬歇爾：對。我們來談談施萊辛格時期和這個過渡。

--- 段落 189 (423 字元) ---
Schlesinger and I sat down and talked, once I got here, about what areas he’s  particularly interested in having some assessments done.There were three: the  NATO-Warsaw Pact balance, the strategic forces balance, and the maritime balance.So we started off to do things in all those areas.- Q2: Who did you have working on those?- Marshall: I think that at that point, well, Chip Pickett started off on the NATOWarsaw Pact.

[翻譯]
施萊辛格和我坐下來談話，一旦我到達這裡，我們討論了他特別感興趣進行評估的範疇。有三個範疇：北約-華沙條約平衡、戰略力量平衡和海上平衡。所以我們開始在所有這些範疇進行工作。問題2：您是找誰來進行這些工作的？馬歇爾：我認為在那個時候，奇普·皮克特開始研究北約-華沙條約。

--- 段落 190 (426 字元) ---
- Q4: When Marshall came over to the Pentagon he took Robin Pirie with him, actually moved everybody in the office except one, and there was just the same office  replicated here.It was that way until…Lee Badgett?- Marshall: Yeah.- Q4: …joins in the middle of ‘74, something like that.- Marshall: Right.- Q2: And he was a Navy guy, right?- Marshall: Air Force.- Q2: He was here to do the strategic forces?- Marshall: Well, no.

[翻譯]
問題4：當馬歇爾來到五角大樓時，他帶著羅賓·皮裡一起來，實際上把辦公室裡的每個人都搬走了，只剩下一個，這裡只是複製了同樣的辦公室。一直持續到李·巴吉特來了，對吧？- 馬歇爾：對。- 問題4：....在74年中期加入，類似這樣的時間。- 馬歇爾：對。- 問題2：他是海軍的，對嗎？- 馬歇爾：空軍。- 問題2：他是來這裡負責戰略力量的嗎？- 馬歇爾：嗯，不是。

--- 段落 191 (476 字元) ---
He came and because of his background, he was really more  associated with the Soviet military budget and that sort of thing.- Q4: He came from the Air Force Academy faculty?- Marshall: Yes.And then James Roche replaced Pirie.- Q2: When was that?- Marshall: ‘75, the middle of ‘75, or spring of ‘75.- Q4: Robin retires and goes to the Congressional Budget Office or something.- Marshall: Right, yeah.Then we have some additional thing, I guess Peter Sharfman  is the next one.

[翻譯]
他來了，由於他的背景，他與蘇聯軍事預算等更相關。- Q4：他來自空軍學院教職嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的。然後，詹姆斯·羅奇取代皮里。- Q2：那是什麼時候？- 馬歇爾：'75年，'75年中期或'75年春天。- Q4：羅賓退休去了國會預算辦公室或其他地方。- 馬歇爾：對，是的。然後我們有一些其他事情，我想彼得·夏夫曼是下一個。

--- 段落 192 (485 字元) ---
- Q4: No, I think Bob Sorley comes in …  
- Q2: To replace Pickett?- Q4: …late.No, because he arrives, Sorley must arrive after Jim.Pickett leaves the  summer of ‘76, Sorley must be there for six to nine months before then…  
- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: Did he pick up the NATO stuff?- Q4: I think, yeah, well, he was only there…  
- Marshall: But Sharfman came, because in the spring of ‘76 he was involved in these  Israeli talks.Toward the fall, we started meeting twice a year with them.

[翻譯]
- Q4: 不，我想鮑勃·索利會接替...
- Q2: 代替皮凱特嗎？- Q4: ...晚了。不，因為他到達了，所以索利必須在吉姆之後到達。皮凱特在1976年夏天離開，索利必須在那之前待上六到九個月...
- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q2：他有拿到北約的東西嗎？- Q4：我想是的，嗯，他當時只在那裡...
- 馬歇爾：但夏夫曼來了，因為在1976年春季，他參與了這些以色列談判。到了秋天，我們開始每年會兩次見面。

--- 段落 193 (481 字元) ---
58  
- Q2: I thought Roche did those.- Marshall: He and Sharfman.- Q2: Oh, they both did.- Marshall: Anyway, Sharfman took over the strategic things.At some point, Fred  Giessler shows up.- Q2: But when you first started out, Schlesinger wanted these three studies.You had  Pickett working NATO-Warsaw Pact.Who was working strategic forces?- Marshall: Me, I guess.- Q2: And then Pirie did the maritime balance?- Marshall: Yeah, started that.- Q2: And then you did strategic forces.

[翻譯]
58
- 問題2：我原以為羅氏在負責這些事情。- 馬歇爾：他和夏夫曼。- 問題2：哦，他們兩個都參與嗎？- 馬歇爾：無論如何，夏夫曼負責戰略性事務。某個時候，弗雷德·吉斯勒出現了。- 問題2：但起初，施萊辛格想要進行這三個研究。你讓皮克特負責北約-華沙公約。誰負責戰略部隊？- 馬歇爾：我，我想。- 問題2：然後皮裡負責海上力量平衡嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，開始進行這方面研究。- 問題2：而你則負責戰略部隊。

--- 段落 194 (478 字元) ---
Who did you finally hand that off to?- Marshall: I handed it off to Sharfman.- Q4: But it doesn’t get handed off for probably two years or more.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q4: Part of that is that nobody had…nobody in the office had his depth.So the  others were kind of…the two of them, kind of going along after him, trying to  keep him supported.- Q2: So Sharfman comes on board in ‘75.- Marshall: I think late ‘75.- Q2: After Roche.- Marshall: Yeah, probably.- Q2: But before Sorley.

[翻譯]
你最後將它交給了誰？- 馬歇爾：我把它交給了夏夫曼。- Q4：但大概要過兩年或更長的時間才會交接。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q4：部分原因是辦公室裡沒有人…辦公室裡沒有人能夠有他那樣的深度。所以其他人在他之後，試著支持他。- Q2：所以夏夫曼是在1975年加入的。- 馬歇爾：我想是在1975年晚些時候。- Q2：在羅奇之後。- 馬歇爾：對，可能是。- Q2：但在索利之前。

--- 段落 195 (444 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q4: You have to check the dates.I’m just not sure.- Marshall: Yeah, right.You’d have to check those and so on.OK, so we are doing these.We basically have three fundamental tasks.One was  to do these assessments for the Secretary, proprietary assessments to him.Then  the idea was that we were going to try to stimulate each of the Services to create  a net assessment activity.The only one that succeeded was the Navy.

[翻譯]
Marshall：是的，沒錯。- Q4：你必須檢查日期，我只是不確定。- Marshall：是的，沒錯。你必須檢查那些資料等等。好的，我們正在做這些。我們基本上有三個基本任務。其中之一是為部長做這些評估，向他做專有評估。然後想法是，我們要試圖激勵各服務創建一個網絡評估活動。唯一成功的是海軍。

--- 段落 196 (444 字元) ---
The Army  didn’t do anything, they created a point of contact, which was Ed Vandiver.The Air  Force didn’t do anything except some special projects later, around ‘76, ‘77.Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, Chief of Naval Operations, created a net assessment  activity.- Q2: Who headed that?- Marshall: Later it’s Bill Manthorpe, but earlier it was this fellow who had a heart  attack and died, didn’t die but [indistinct].Yeah, you’d have to go back, right.

[翻譯]
陸軍沒有做什麼，他們只是創建了一個聯絡點，就是艾德·范迪佛。空軍除了一些特殊項目外，在'76年、'77年左右沒有做什麼。 海軍作戰部長厄爾莫·茲姆沃爾特創建了一個網絡評估活動。問：誰領導了這個？馬歇爾：後來是比爾·曼索夫，但早期是這位因心臟病發作而死的人，沒死，但 [不明確]。是的，你需要回到過去哈。

--- 段落 197 (497 字元) ---
At any rate, the third thing was to undertake a development program of tools,  methods, databases, and so on.In addition to these formal things, Schlesinger used me a lot as an intermediary  with the intelligence community.Soon after he came here, he called Proctor down  and said, “I just find it hard to believe that the Soviet military effort consists of six  percent of their gross national product.Will you go take another look at that and  tell me why any reasonable man should believe that?

[翻譯]
不管怎樣，第三件事是進行一個工具、方法、數據庫等方面的開發計劃。除了這些正式的事情外，舒萊辛格經常讓我擔任與情報界之間的中介。他來這裡不久後，叫來普羅克特，說：“我真的很難相信蘇聯軍事努力佔他們國民生產總值的百分之六。你可以再去看看，告訴我為什麼任何理智的人應該相信這個事情嗎？”

--- 段落 198 (441 字元) ---
” When I came, he told me  about that and then we had some further meetings.Then they finally decided they  were going to write something and look at it, and they came back with a paper that  was totally unconvincing, that said the most it could be is, like, about one percent  off in either direction.Then in ‘76, of course, they… they’d known about it for  about a year, but in ‘76 they had to change it and move it up to 12 to 13 percent.

[翻譯]
當我到達時，他告訴我關於那件事然後我們進行了進一步的會議。然後他們最終決定要寫一些東西並查看它，他們回來的文件完全沒有說服力，只說可能差距在一個百分點以內。然後當然在'76，他們...他們已經知道這一點大約一年，但在'76年他們不得不將它的範圍修改為12至13個百分點。

--- 段落 199 (474 字元) ---
And I have the paper, the memos that I wrote for Schlesinger back to them.59  
- Q2: What forced them to raise it?- Q4: Oh, it was the inflation rate.- Marshall: No, what forced them to raise it was an emigre who came out, who had  seen some books that were convincing to them.60 Plus, when they went and did  some work on the dollar-ruble exchange rates for some selected systems that  they had some evidence on, they decided that they had been way off for modern  systems.

[翻譯]
我有寫給舒萊辛格的檔案，我會把我寫給他們的備忘錄放回去。問題2：是什麼迫使他們提高了利率？問題4：哦，是通脹率。馬歇爾：不，迫使他們提高是一個移民出來，他看見一些對他們說服力的書籍。另外，當他們去做一些有關美元盧布匯率的工作，對一些他們有證據的選定系統，他們認為他們對現代系統完全錯誤。

--- 段落 200 (333 字元) ---
61  
- Q2: So that’s in ‘76 that they raised it to 12 percent?- Marshall: Yeah, I think early ‘76.62  
- Q4: What I thought was interesting about then, and I was really on the periphery  of it, was that there had to be some sort of seminal event, one, two, or three that  would force this estimate, and these people to make a change.

[翻譯]
- Q2：所以他們在'76年將它提高到12%？- 馬歇爾：是的，我想是在'76年初。
- Q4：我覺得那時很有趣的是，我當時真的只是在邊緣，必須有一些開創性的事件，一個、兩個或三個事件，才能迫使這些人做出改變。

--- 段落 201 (417 字元) ---
There would have  to be an emigre who came and said, “I actually saw the books and it’s wrong,” or there was some very sensitive intelligence information in several cases that  would enable them to get a window of insight, which was not a random sample  window, but it was a window.And they have to go back and question themselves.But they couldn’t bring themselves to go about doing it on their own.- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
必須有一位移民來到這裡並說：“我實際看到那些書，結果是錯誤的”，或者在幾種情況下有一些非常敏感的情報信息可以讓他們獲得洞察的機會，這不是一個隨機樣本視窗，而是一個窗口。他們不得不回頭檢視自己。但他們無法獨自去做這件事。- 馬歇爾: 對。

--- 段落 202 (383 字元) ---
- Q4: One of the problems with the community, it could not…it needed an external  stimuli that was sort of uncontroversial in its implications.- Marshall: In some ways, there’s not a lot to talk about, I think, about the Schlesinger  period, in the sense that, the period of startup…Well, there is one other thing.As I  mentioned, we had started this assessment on the ground forces.

[翻譯]
Q4: 社區存在的問題之一是，它無法…它需要一個在意義上無爭議的外部刺激。- 馬歇爾：在某種程度上，講論舒萊辛格時期並沒有太多可談論的，我想，即在啟動期間…唔，還有一件事。就像我提到的，我們開始對地面部隊進行評估。

--- 段落 203 (458 字元) ---
One of the first  things that we did when we got here was to take over responsibility for that and  having it finished.When the final report was being prepared, and we’d not had  much to do with it up to that time…  [gap for tape change]  …it called for a listing or discussion of the strengths and weaknesses on both  sides.When it came to the final thing, the intelligence people, the DIA guys,  simply would not put down any weaknesses on the Soviet side.

[翻譯]
我們剛到這裡時，首先做的事情之一就是承擔責任，確保事情完成。當最終報告正在準備時，而在那之前我們沒怎麼參與其中......在最後關頭，情報人員、國防情報局的人，簡直就是不肯在蘇聯一方列出任何弱點。

--- 段落 204 (398 字元) ---
At one point  they had made the preposterous explanation that, yes, they might have some  weaknesses, but even if they did exist, they would notice them and fix them, so  that it wasn’t worth talking about them or taking much notice of them.I remember saying to them, “Would that that were so about our weaknesses.” So it was  resolved, finally, by Lt.Gen.Danny Graham, who had just taken over DIA.

[翻譯]
有一段時間，他們曾經做出荒謬的解釋，認為他們可能有一些弱點，但即使存在，他們也會察覺並修正，因此不值得談論它們或太過關注它們。我記得對他們說過：“希望我們的弱點也能如此。”最終由剛接任DIA的Danny Graham中將解決這個問題。

--- 段落 205 (489 字元) ---
And  talking with him… Danny and I had gotten to know one another, I guess, while  I was still at the NSC.We had talked a lot about Soviet weaknesses, so he wasn’t  in any position to say that the Soviets didn’t have any weaknesses.So he got it  changed.But it’s just symptomatic of these people.The constant weakness of the  intelligence community, this unwillingness to really deal with, or to have an intelligent assessment of the opponent’s weaknesses.- Q4: Let me give you an example.

[翻譯]
與他交談時……丹尼和我彼此已經認識了，我想，在我仍在國家安全委員會的時候。我們討論過蘇聯的弱點很多次，所以他無法說蘇聯沒有弱點。所以他改變了看法。但這只是這些人的典型特徵。情報界持續的弱點，對真正處理對手的弱點或做出明智評估的不願意。－Q4：讓我給你一個例子。

--- 段落 206 (311 字元) ---
There were a whole set of four or five myths that  they had about the Soviet Army.One of which was that the Russians are stupid  because they design the T-62 tank and only somebody who was less than about  six foot, five foot-eleven, or something like that could fit into it.And they made  a big play out of it.

[翻譯]
有一整套四五個他們對蘇聯軍隊的神話。其中之一是俄羅斯人很笨，因為他們設計了T-62坦克，只有不到六英尺高、五英尺十一英寸高的人才能進入。他們對此大肆宣揚。

--- 段落 207 (489 字元) ---
And there was in a meeting with one of these intel guys and  a couple of people from the Army made this comment, and Pickett said, “Pardon  me, but do you have demographic data on the average height of the Soviet  male?” “Well, yes we do.” “What is it, what is the average height of the Soviet  male?” “Probably about 5-foot-6.” And Pickett said, “So are they designing the  tank…” Pickett said, “What is the height of a male who can climb in the Army M-  60?” And the answer was 6-foot-4.

[翻譯]
在一次與情報人員和幾名陸軍人員的會議中，皮科特說：“請原諒我，但你有關於蘇聯男性平均身高的人口統計數據嗎？” “是的，我們有。” “那麼，蘇聯男性的平均身高是多少？” “大概5英尺6英寸。” 皮科特說：“那麼他們是不是在設計坦克…” 皮科特問：“能夠爬進陸軍M-60坦克的男性身高是多少？” 答案是6英尺4英寸。

--- 段落 208 (428 字元) ---
And Pickett said, “Where is that on the height  distribution?” Guy on the Army staff said, “It’s on the 99th percentile.” Pickett said,  “Shall we go back and try this all over again about who is stupid?” And it was just  these… the guys who were doing [indistinct] analysis for the Defense Intelligence  Agency, had just a very narrow focus on that.It was just absolutely phenomenal.And there are other stories.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
皮克特說："這在高度分布中的位置在哪裡？"陸軍參謀的一名人士說："這是在第99個百分位數上。"皮克特說："我們要回去，再試一次看看誰愚蠢嗎？"當時這些在為國防情報局進行【不清楚】分析的人，對這個問題非常狹窄地聚焦在那一點。這實在令人驚訝。還有其他的故事吧。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 209 (476 字元) ---
The other thing to say about this period is—I guess we talked about  it before, the last time—that one of the things that Schlesinger was very interested in, and, in fact, both of us were because we had talked a lot about it back  at RAND, was this whole aspect of the political-psychological impact or use of  military forces, their role beyond fighting, or getting your way without fighting by  looking impressive enough, and so on.I think we’d both been interested in that.

[翻譯]
這段時期要說的另一件事是，我想我們之前已經談過了，那就是施萊辛格非常感興趣的一個事情，事實上，我們兩個人都很感興趣，因為在蘭德公司時我們曾多次討論過這個話題，就是軍事力量的政治心理影響或使用，他們在戰鬥之外的作用，或者藉著看起來令人印象深刻來達到目的，等等。我想我們兩個都對此感興趣。

--- 段落 210 (323 字元) ---
I  had been interested in that going way back because of Goldhamer and Leites and  so on.Something that was very important for both Schlesinger and I, while we  were both at RAND, was reading Robert Ardrey’s The Territorial Imperative, which  immediately raises the issue of the nonrational aspects of man and his behavior.

[翻譯]
我很早就對這個感興趣，因為Goldhamer和Leites等等。當我們兩個都在蘭德公司時，對於舒萊辛格和我來說很重要的一件事是閱讀羅伯特·阿德里的《領土本能》，這立刻提出了人和他的行為的非理性方面的問題。

--- 段落 211 (383 字元) ---
63  Our interest was based partly on an obvious fact of history, that coercion and  display of forces and so on are used to gain your ends without fighting, and also  on the possibility that this is not just a matter of, you show up and the other guy  does a set of calculations and so on, but that there are other mechanisms at work  and that you ought to understand that and so on.

[翻譯]
我們的興趣部分基於歷史上的明顯事實，即使用脅迫、展示力量等手段來在不用交戰的情況下達到目的，同時也基於這種可能性：這不僅僅是你出現後對方進行一系列計算等等，還可能存在其他機制在發揮作用，因此你應該理解這一點。

--- 段落 212 (440 字元) ---
So one of the other things I did for Schlesinger, after sort of getting on board,  was to start this whole program of work on perceptions and so on.Now, actually,  when I was working for Henry, I had already started down this road by making a  request to the Agency—again, Henry was a naturally interested party in this kind  of thing—and so we… Remember this Bob Levine?- Q4: Um-hum.- Marshall: So we assigned this one guy to do this work.

[翻譯]
所以在加入後，我為舒萊辛格做的另一件事是開始整個關於知覺等工作的計劃。實際上，在為亨利工作時，我已經踏上了這條路，通過向機構提出了這個要求——亨利是這類事情的自然關注方——所以我們...還記得這個鮑勃·萊文嗎？- Q4：嗯嗯。- 馬歇爾：所以我們指派了這個人來做這項工作。

--- 段落 213 (453 字元) ---
The idea was to try to look  at everything we could find from the Soviets to find out: “What is it that they pay  attention to about us?What sorts of things seem to give us high scores in their  books?What things don’t matter or give us low scores?” In other words, how can  we then start to do those things or show those characteristics which impress  them and influence their assessments?When I got here, Schlesinger was very, very interested in this.

[翻譯]
這個想法是嘗試看一切我們可以從蘇聯找到的東西，以找出：「他們關注我們的哪些方面？什麼類型的事情似乎在他們的書籍中給我們高分？什麼事情並不重要或給我們低分？」換句話說，我們如何開始做那些事情或展現那些特點，以給他們留下深刻印象並影響他們的評估？當我到達這裡時，舒曼格對此非常感興趣。

--- 段落 214 (481 字元) ---
It was one of his  absolutely fundamental views about things.So I started this work.I got some  money from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.Stephen Lukasik  was the head of DARPA then, and I think, probably, Schlesinger had called him.So I went over, and one of the first projects we started was the stuff that started  out at RAND with Herb Goldhamer in charge.There was a meeting at RAND.64  That’s when I first met Lionel Tiger, but I had read his book before that.

[翻譯]
這是他對事物的絕對基本觀點之一。所以我開始了這項工作。我從國防部高級研究計劃署得到了一些資金。當時Stephen Lukasik是DARPA的負責人，我想，可能是Schlesinger叫他來的。所以我前往，我們開始的第一個項目之一是在RAND由Herb Goldhamer負責的工作。那時在RAND舉行了一次會議。那是我第一次遇見Lionel Tiger，但在那之前我已讀過他的書。

--- 段落 215 (476 字元) ---
I had read  both Men in Groups and The Imperial Animal.Men in Groups probably came out in  around ‘70 or ‘69, or something like that [1969].65 The Imperial Animal came out  in ‘73 [1971].66 We invited him and a bunch of others and started off this whole  series of things.- Q2: Who was it— You said RAND was taking the lead on this?Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: Who was doing it there?- Marshall: Herb Goldhamer.And he continued on with a whole bunch of things up  to the time he died.

[翻譯]
我曾經讀過《Men in Groups》和《The Imperial Animal》。《Men in Groups》應該是在70或69年左右出版的，《The Imperial Animal》是在73年出版的。我們邀請了他和一群其他人，開始了這一系列的活動。問題2：是誰，你說蘭德公司在這方面領先？馬歇爾：對。問題2：在那裡是誰在做這件事？馬歇爾：赫伯·戈德哈默。他一直繼續做很多事情，直到他去世的時候。

--- 段落 216 (341 字元) ---
67 The other thing to say about this period is, again, this kind of contrast between  Schlesinger and Kissinger.Kissinger, I think, really had a very pessimistic view of  America’s future.He really did, and at that time, given what the hell was going on  in this country, one had some rights to be pessimistic.But Schlesinger wasn’t at  all.

[翻譯]
在這個時期另一個要提及的事情是，再次提及薛辛格和基辛格之間的對比。我認為，基辛格對美國的未來非常悲觀。在那個時候，鑑於這個國家正在發生的混亂局面，他擁有悲觀的理由。但薛辛格卻完全不同。

--- 段落 217 (486 字元) ---
[Indistinct] In fact, I think one of the most interesting things that Schlesinger  ever said—I think it was in some Time magazine [11 Feb ‘74] article—which I think  people never understood very well, was that he thought of himself as an “evangelist”  [in the article, Schlesinger says “revivalist”].68 A lot of the conflict between Kissinger and Schlesinger had to do with this very different view of what the long-term  strengths and weaknesses were between ourselves and the Soviets.

[翻譯]
事實上，我認為舒勒辛格曾經說過最有趣的一點是他自認為是一位「佈道者」（在某個《時代雜誌》[1974年2月11日]的文章中提到，舒勒辛格說是「復興運動者」）。基辛格和舒勒辛格之間的許多衝突都源於對我們和蘇聯之間長期實力和弱點的非常不同看法。

--- 段落 218 (497 字元) ---
Once again,  this was probably one of these areas where having some sense of economics and  so on, even if it’s the Agency’s, which was pushing out all this bum dope about  the Soviet economy, in the sense that [indistinct] the U.S.is not badly off, but a…  
- Q2: Were you involved in the move toward limited nuclear options at all at this  point?69  
- Marshall: Yeah, right, although Donald Cotter, Assistant to the Secretary of Defense  for Atomic Energy, was the main person involved in that.

問題2：您在此時是否有參與向有限核選項進展的過程中？
答：是的，盡管唐納德·科特，國防部核能源秘書助理，是其中的主要參與者。

- Q2: But your strategic force assessment, I mean, did you have one out, or in some  form that Schlesinger looked at before they started doing that, or was that preceded…  
- Marshall: No, no, no.That came about because of Schlesinger’s own work when  he was at RAND.One of the major things he did before leaving…well, it started  back probably around ‘66, ‘67, ‘68.

[翻譯]
問2：但是您的戰略力量評估，我的意思是，在舒萊辛格開始進行該評估之前，您是否已經有一個評估報告或某種形式的評估？或者先前有…  
馬歇爾：不，不，不。那是因為舒萊辛格在RAND機構工作時所做的工作。在他離職之前，他完成了一項重要的工作…嗯，大概始於1966年或1967年或1968年左右。

70 One of the things he spent most of his time  on was this issue of “the least miserable option,” which was the way it was talked  about.You know, if you really face up to the thing of what are you actually going  to do after deterrence has failed, then this notion of simply unleashing the Single  Integrated Operational Plan is—  
- Q2: —is silly.- Marshall: Absolutely, nonsense.- Q2: Cotter was at AE, or where was he?- Marshall: He was in AE.

[翻譯]
他花費了大部分時間處理的問題之一是“最不痛苦的選擇”，這就是人們所談論的方式。你知道，如果你真正面對的是當遏制失敗後，你究竟要做什麼，那麼單純解放單一集成作戰計劃的想法是——
- Q2: —荒謬的。- 馬歇爾: 絕對，胡說八道。- Q2: Cotter在AE還是在哪裡？- 馬歇爾: 他在AE。

When Schlesinger was at the Atomic Energy Commission,  he picked up a bunch of people who became very close to him and he brought  along.One was Cotter.Cotter maybe had been down at Sandia National Laboratories, I forget exactly.Another was Hoffmann.- Q2: Fred?- Marshall: No, the fellow who became the Secretary of the Army later on.- Q2: Oh, Marty Hoffmann.- Marshall: Marty Hoffmann, who was a lawyer.

[翻譯]
當施萊辛格在原子能委員會時，他找了一群人，他們與他非常親近，並帶他們一起去。其中一個是考特。考特可能早些時候曾在聖地亞哥國家實驗室工作，我忘了確切的情況。另一個是霍夫曼 - 問題2：弗雷德？- 馬歇爾：不是，後來成為陸軍部長的那個人。- 問題2：哦，是馬蒂·霍夫曼。- 馬歇爾：馬蒂·霍夫曼，是一位律師。

--- 段落 222 (291 字元) ---
He was the legal counsel, I think,  at Atomic Energy and Schlesinger brought him over and]made him the legal  counsel here.The secretary, Evelyn Irons, who he brought with… well, maybe she  showed up first.She maybe was with OMB and then went with him to…yes, she  was first with him in OMB.

[翻譯]
他曾是原子能機構的法律顧問，我想，施萊辛格帶他過來，讓他在這裡擔任法律顧問。他帶來的秘書是伊夫林·艾恩斯，也許她先來了。她可能先在OMB工作，然後跟隨他一起去… 是的，她首先在OMB跟隨他工作。

So there were a cluster of people that… 
- Q2: Were they your main allies in the Building [Eds: the Pentagon], or who were your  main kind of two or three, besides the Secretary, who were you kind of—Zumwalt  and you close at all?- Marshall: A little bit, and I was on that Chief of Naval Operations Executive Panel  that he had formed.I joined it in ‘72, when I was still at the NSC, and continued  while here.I would say that Cotter was a big ally.I liked him, although Lukasik was  very helpful.

[翻譯]
所以有一群人...... 
- Q2:他們是您在建築物[編輯：五角大樓]中的主要盟友，還是除了部長之外，您主要的兩三位，例如祖姆瓦特和您有密切關係嗎？ - 馬歇爾：一點點，我當時在他組建的海軍作戰部主管小組中。我在‘72年加入，當時仍在NSC，後來在這裡也繼續。我想說科特是一個很大的盟友。我喜歡他，盡管盧卡西克也很有幫助。

Cotter and Pete Haas, Deputy Director for Science and Technology of  the Defense Nuclear Agency…  See, the problem was that they wanted to do a whole bunch of things and I was  in a very good bureaucratic position to help them, because, after all, Net Assessment can do anything, right?I mean look at almost any issue.So they wanted  to do a lot of work on the Soviet doctrine, and exercises, and so on.

[翻譯]
柯特和皮特·哈斯（Pete Haas），国防核能局科学技术副局长……看，问题是他们想做很多事情，而我正好处于一个非常好的官僚地位可以帮助他们，毕竟，综合评估可以处理任何事情，对吧？我的意思是看看几乎任何问题。所以他们想对苏联的学说、演习等进行大量研究工作。

--- 段落 225 (471 字元) ---
It all started  with a DNA-DARPA effort that began in probably ‘73, ‘72, and was called the New  Alternatives thing.It was an effort to look at technologies and what could they do  for you, and it was there that there was this first, not really first, but a major push  toward precision-guidance weapons.By the time I moved here in ‘73, Cotter had,  of course, come before me, and he and the DNA people very much wanted to  look at how you would attack the Soviet forces.

[翻譯]
一切始於一個DNA-DARPA的努力，大概是在'73年或'72年開始的，名為新替代方案。這是一個旨在研究技術及其對你有何影響的努力，正是在那裡第一次（雖然不完全是第一次）出現了對精密制導武器的重大推動。到我在'73年搬過來時，柯特當然已經先我一步了，他和DNA的人非常希望研究如何攻擊蘇聯軍隊。

--- 段落 226 (458 字元) ---
And there was this multiplicity of  interests.On the one hand, our position in tactical nuclears meant that they had  to remain dispersed until they tried to converge for attacks quickly, but then you  could try to attack them so that [indistinct] disorganized [indistinct], but in order  to do that you had to look a lot at how they would really come down, and find the  details of their operational arrangements.That’s some of the things they wanted to do.

[翻譯]
在這種情況下，存在著多種利益。一方面，我們在戰術核武器方面的地位意味著它們必須保持分散，直到它們試圖迅速匯合進行攻擊，但隨後你可以試圖攻擊它們，使得它們混亂無序，但為了做到這一點，你必須仔細研究它們到底會如何攻擊，找到它們的作戰安排的細節。這是他們想要做的一些事情。

--- 段落 227 (454 字元) ---
It all verged on being intelligence and  this and that, and they would be precluded from doing it.But if I tasked them to do  it, then they could do that, or they could then get the intelligence people to go along  with whatever.So they came seeking me.Also, Haas came offering lots of money,  not only for the things that they wanted to do, but things I wanted to do.Additionally, I had no budget, so I got money for studies out of DNA and out of DARPA.

[翻譯]
這一切都涉及情報和種種事情，他們會被禁止這樣做。但如果我讓他們這樣做，他們可以這樣做，或者他們可以讓情報人員配合。所以他們來找我。此外，哈斯提出了許多錢，不僅用於他們想做的事情，還包括我想做的事情。此外，我沒有預算，所以我從DNA和DARPA這里得到了進行研究的資金。

- Q4: A thing about the bureaucratic aspects of this: somewhere in this same period  there is, what’s it called, Net Technical Assessment, NTA, run by Jim Wade at that  point?‘75?‘74?- Marshall: No, it was that retired Army general, John something.- Q4: There was a Navy Admiral also.Maybe it was a retired Navy admiral at the time.- Marshall: Yes, oh that’s right.- Q4: Yeah, it was a retired Navy admiral.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q4: Then there’s another guy named Don Marshall—  
- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
Q4：關於這件事的官僚方面：在這同一時期某處有一個叫做什麼的網絡技術評估，NTA，當時由吉姆·韋德（Jim Wade）負責嗎？那時是'75年？'74年？- 馬歇爾：不是，是那位退役的陸軍將軍約翰某某。- Q4：那時可能也有一位海軍上將。可能當時是一位退役的海軍上將。- 馬歇爾：是的，對，沒錯。- Q4：對，那時可能是一位退役的海軍上將。- 馬歇爾：對。- Q4：然後還有另一位名叫唐·馬歇爾的人——- 馬歇爾：是的。

- Q4: —who was in, I never did figure out where his position was [Special Assistant  (Policy) to the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy], but he  had assessment or net assessment with Schlesinger.- Marshall: Well, he had been out at DNA.- Q2: He was an Air Force colonel, I think.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q4: This one was, he was an Army colonel, Don Marshall.And then there was the  famous Tony Cordesman grab for Net Assessment which occurs in this period.

[翻譯]
Q4: —在內的是誰，我始終沒搞清楚他的職位是什麼【特別助理（政策）助理的國防部原子能事務秘書】，但他與謝克林格有評估或網絡評估。- 馬歇爾：嗯，他過去在DNA。- Q2：我想他是空軍上校。- 馬歇爾：對，是的。- Q4：這個是一位陸軍上校，唐·馬歇爾。然後在這個時期發生了著名的托尼·科德斯曼爭奪網絡評估的事件。

- Marshall: That comes later, during the Rumsfeld period.- Q4: Oh, right.- Marshall: Which we haven’t got to and before which we ought to break off.- Q4: You know, at some point in this story, I think you, hope [indistinct] would sort of  do a, what did we learn from the tapestry of these anecdotes about net assessment and how it goes [?], and how you establish it, and so on and so forth.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：那是在後來的魯姆斯菲爾德時期。- Q4：哦，對。- 馬歇爾：我們還沒有談到，而在此之前我們應該先停下來。- Q4：你知道，在這個故事的某個時刻，我覺得你，希望[不清楚]會進行一個，我們從這些軼事的編織中學到了什麼，關於網絡評估以及如何進行評估，等等等等。

--- 段落 231 (452 字元) ---
My  footnote/comment at this point is that there is a story which has to do with how  difficult it is to do this kind of analysis, and therefore how hard it is to convince  others to engage in a particular [indistinct].When we were trying to convince the  Army that they ought to be doing things, we took on, sort of… For example, there  was the tank crew training net assessment comparison…  
- Marshall: Yes, now that happened later… well, maybe not.

[翻譯]
這裡我想補充一下，這個故事和分析這種事情有多困難有關，因此也很難說服他人參與某個特定的活動。當我們試圖說服軍方應該採取行動時，我們承擔了這樣的...例如，有一個坦克機組訓練網絡評估比較...  
- 馬歇爾：是的，這發生在稍後...也許不是。

--- 段落 232 (466 字元) ---
I forget…  
- Q4: …well, the point was that there were people who were saying, “Why would we  want to compare ourselves to the way the Soviets train their tank crews, because  our training establishments don’t fight.Our tanks fight.So who the hell cares  if they train one way and we train another.” It’s obviously an extraordinarily, in  my view, just simpleminded point for them to take, but you would say it was an  example of how difficult it was to engage them.

[翻譯]
我忘記了...
- Q4：...嗯，重點是有人說：“為什麼我們要比較蘇聯如何訓練他們的坦克組員，因為我們的訓練單位不會參與戰鬥，我們的坦克才會參與戰鬥。所以他們訓練的方式和我們訓練的方式有什麼關係。”在我看來，這顯然是一個非常簡單的要點，但你可能會說這是他們很難參與的一個例子。

--- 段落 233 (402 字元) ---
There was another aspect of the net assessment one, sort of really subtext, was  just simply getting people to compare things.- Marshall: Yes.- Q4: Because of what you might learn by asking, “Why are they different?” People  were very reluctant to do that.- Marshall: Remember the other thing that Pickett was involved in we had this captured equipment.Q2: Oh, from the ‘73 war.- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
在網路評估中，還有另一個方面，實際上是一種潛在的意義，就是讓人們簡單地比較事物。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q4：因為你可能通過問「為什麼它們不同？」來學到東西。人們非常不願意這樣做。- 馬歇爾：記得皮克特參與的另一件事，我們有這些俘虜的裝備。Q2：哦，來自73年的戰爭。- 馬歇爾：對，沒錯。

--- 段落 234 (435 字元) ---
And there were all kinds of stories about this stuff and how  terrible it was, and how difficult it was, and so on.So…  
- Q4: In particular, one was this business about Russian tanks are so much better than  American tanks.No, American tanks are so much better than Russian tanks.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q4: So you basically forced a runoff between an [Eds: American] M-60 and a [Eds:  Soviet] T-62 out at Aberdeen.- Marshall: Right.

[翻譯]
有各種關於這些東西有多糟糕、有多困難等等的故事。所以...Q4：特別是，有一個關於俄羅斯坦克比美國坦克好得多的傳聞。不，美國坦克比俄羅斯坦克好得多。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- Q4：所以你基本上在阿伯丁逼使一輛 [美國] M-60 和一輛 [蘇聯] T-62 進行了決賽對決。- 馬歇爾：對。

--- 段落 235 (483 字元) ---
- Q4: And took an American crew and drove one, and took an American crew and  drove the other and put them over various obstacle courses.And then they got  back these observations like, “Well, yeah, you’re right, the M-60 has an automatic  transmission and the Russian one does not, and the M-60 has a steering wheel  and the Russian has a sort of lever.” But the driver said, “I mean it’s no big deal.It  doesn’t require that much more force to shift gears,” and so on and so forth.

[翻譯]
Q4：然後讓一組美國機組人員開一輛車，讓另一組美國機組人員開另一輛，並將它們通過各種障礙課程。然後他們得到這樣的觀察：“是的，你是對的，M-60有自動變速箱而俄羅斯的沒有，M-60有方向盤而俄羅斯的有一種槓桿。”但駕駛說，“我的意思是這不是什麼大問題。換檔不需要更多的力氣”，等等。

--- 段落 236 (472 字元) ---
Then  there was another one about, well, the crew compartment [Eds: in the T-62] is  much too tight, and the comment from the loader or the tank commander was,  “This is the only tank that I’ve ever been in where you can probably sleep while  you are driving, while it was being driven across… because you are wedged in  tight enough that you don’t bang your head against every piece of the…” I mean  it was just one thing after another one.- Marshall: Right, yeah, right.

[翻譯]
接著有另一個關於T-62的問題，那就是，車員艙太過狹窄，裝填手或坦克指揮官的評論是，“這是我所見過唯一可以在開車時躺下睡覺的坦克... 因為你坐得太緊了，不會撞到每一個部件... ”我是說，一個接著一個問題。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

--- 段落 237 (283 字元) ---
And Pickett went around and interviewed the people  who were putting these things back in working order and had driven them a lot  just to see… See, a lot of the claims were that these are so uncomfortable, so  bad, that people, once they’re in them for a while, just can’t function.

[翻譯]
皮克特四處走動，採訪那些負責修復這些設備並且長時間使用它們的人，只是為了看一看…因為很多人聲稱這些設備非常不舒適，太糟糕了，以至於人們一旦在其中待上一段時間，就無法正常運作。

--- 段落 238 (402 字元) ---
And one of  the tests for the tank involved the fact that the scoring system was related to the  accuracy and pointing and firing the gun; the notion was that they would get so  tired that the scores would go way down.It didn’t turn out to be true.And there  were wild stories about, you know, people can’t do it, their backs go out, this or  that.Then there was the ZSU…  
- Q4: 23-4?- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
而其中一項測試是關於坦克的，涉及的是評分系統與準確性，操作開火的槍砲；假設是他們會累壞，導致分數急劇下降。這並不是真的。還有關於人們無法完成任務，背部受傷等種種荒謬故事。然後是ZSU...
- Q4：23-4嗎？-馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 239 (502 字元) ---
- Q4: Another sort of piece, there were a lot of stories, but one of the pieces that has  to do with how the intelligence community does the analysis of these kinds of  systems… For example, if you handed them a T-62 or you handed them a ZSU-  23-4 and asked them for an appraisal of sort of the crew comfort and operational  effectiveness, for example, what they gave you back were these very precise  psychometric measures on vehicle, sort of, this will take a person who has a sitting  height of 34.

[翻譯]
問題四：另一種類型的故事，有很多故事，但其中一個與情報界如何分析這種類型的系統有關...例如，如果你交給他們一輛T-62或一輛ZSU-23-4，並要求他們評估車組的舒適度和運行效果，例如，他們給你的是這些非常精確的心理測量值，諸如車輛需要具有34英寸坐高的人。

675 inches, to three-digit accuracies, which is the 60th percentile of  the average height of the European male, and it has a leg room of 32.7215 inches,  which will accommodate da-da, da-da.And after you got through reading this  tremendous amount of data…  
- Q2: “What does that mean?”  
- Q4: And they were proud about the output, the people who produced this, and it  was just absolutely just narrow, but they were very enthused about the output.

[翻譯]
675英吋，精確到三位數，這是歐洲男性平均身高的百分之六十位，腿部空間為32.7215英吋，可以容納達達，達達。當你讀完這麼多數據後...

- 問題4：他們對這個輸出感到自豪，生產這個的人非常熱情，儘管範圍很窄，但他們對輸出感到非常熱衷。

But it had no relevance and it wasn’t like it had relevance to anybody, you could  determine.It was a repeat of what we had seen elsewhere, and people were producing things because that’s what they had produced before, and the mere fact  of the production was a reward in its own right.The fact that it wasn’t very useful  was irrelevant.- Marshall: I forget about timing of the tank crew thing, but it ended up in the hands  of [Gen.

[翻譯]
但這跟任何人都無關，你可以確定。這是我們在其他地方看到過的重複，人們做事情只是因為他們以前做過，而僅僅是生產的事實本身就是一種獎勵。它並不是很有用這個事實是無關緊要的。- 馬歇爾: 我忘了坦克車組的時間，但它最終被交到了[Gen.

] Paul Gorman, who was then at the Army Training and Doctrine Command.Best single study every done by any Service for me.- Q4: Gorman has this meeting with Andy.Door closes.And he looks at Andy, and he  says, “Mr.Marshall, off the record, we have a national disaster here.” That was his  lead in, and it got better thereafter.- Marshall: Right.- Q4: Probably can’t write that up.- Marshall: Right, right.“Give us time to fix it.Do you mind if the study is delayed?”  [Indistinct] later fix this.

[翻譯]
保羅·戈爾曼當時在陸軍訓練與教義指揮部。對我而言，這是各軍種進行過的最好的單一研究。- Q4：戈爾曼與安迪有過這樣的會議。門關上了。然後他看著安迪，說：“馬歇爾先生，不記名地，我們這裡發生了一場國家災難。”這是他的引子，之後情況變得更好。- 馬歇爾：對。- Q4：可能不能把這個寫出來。- 馬歇爾：對，對。“給我們時間來修正它。你介意研究推遲嗎？”[聽不清的]等一下修正這個。

- Q4: He was a brigadier at this point.- Marshall: A one-star.- Q2: A one-star, so were you over here when he was at CIA?- Marshall: Yes.- Q2: And did you have any interactions with him?- Marshall: Yes I did.

- Q2: 他曾是美國中央情報局（CIA）的一般目的部際國家情報官...
- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。

[翻譯]
問2：他在擔任國家情報長官時寫了一篇最初是機密的《情報研究》，我認為目前仍是機密的東西，內容是如何進行網絡評估。這是一篇非常好的文章。您對他在中央情報局任職時的互動有什麼特別的印象嗎？您曾經和他一起進行過哪些專案嗎？
- 馬歇爾：我們的互動不多。之前有一些友好的關係，但沒有太多可以互動的內容。

--- 段落 245 (468 字元) ---
- Q2: So you didn’t provide specific support on the ground forces assessment or  anything like that?- Marshall: No.- Q4: When does Project 186 and Phil Karber begin to appear on the horizon?After  the Schlesinger period?- Marshall: No, it had started before.It had started before I even got here.Karber was  put under contract by Pat Parker, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Assessment, to start the thing.Then I just took it over when it… Right.

[翻譯]
- Q2: 所以您對陸軍評估沒有提供具體支持或類似的東西嗎？- 馬歇爾: 沒有。- Q4: Project 186和Phil Karber是在什麼時候開始出現在地平線上？在施萊辛格時期之後嗎？- 馬歇爾: 不，它在施萊辛格時期之前就開始了。甚至在我來這裡之前就已經開始了。Karber是由副國防部長辦公室情報評估副助理秘書帕特·帕克簽訂合同開始這個計劃的。然後當...時，我接手了這個計劃。

- Q2: And you started Project Eager, when?- Marshall: Project Eager, Project Eager is…  
- Q2: …is, was about ‘73, wasn’t it?- Q4: What’s Eager?- Q2: That’s the thing that led into the SAIC Foreign Systems Research Center, wasn’t it?- Marshall: Yeah.It’s this effort to read all of the Soviet ops research military literature,  and try to understand, to the extent that they are into analytical analyses, modeling and so on, how do they do that?

[翻譯]
- Q2：你什麼時候開始了“Eager計劃”呢？- 馬歇爾：Eager計劃，Eager計劃是...
- Q2：...是大約在'73年左右吧？- Q4：什麼是Eager？- Q2：那不就是導致SAIC外國系統研究中心的事情嗎？- 馬歇爾：對，這是一個努力去閱讀所有蘇聯運籌軍事文獻的項目，試圖理解他們在分析、建模等方面的做法，他們是如何做到的呢？

And what does that tell you about how they  think about, measure things?- Q2: So was that about this time or a little later?- Marshall: I think that was probably around ‘74, ‘75.- Q2: So Schlesinger was…  
- Marshall: I think that Schlesinger actually started down this road when he was at  the CIA, and started it.It was originally a CIA project, and then I became joint with  them, and finally, they dropped out and I was the supporter.

- Q4: You know, Andy, one of the characteristics of this period [indistinct] I’m not  sure on what the grounds [indistinct] it seems to be this constant pressure from  you over literally years to force the agencies to stick the CIA to think about the  Russians or about other opponents…

--- 段落 249 (457 字元) ---
I’d like to be  able to say that that’s probably the first time that the Agency’s been put under  constant pressure, and begin to get away from old-timer’s analysis, but I find it  hard to believe that they could be that insulated, and could be that insulated  from pressures like that in the ‘50s and ‘60s.- Marshall: Well, I think in the ‘50s they were quite open.The reason I got to know  a lot of the Agency guys was because they would come out to RAND.

[翻譯]
我想說，這可能是機構第一次承受持續壓力，並且開始擺脫老一輩的分析，但我很難相信他們可能會那麼與外界隔離，可能在50年代和60年代不受類似壓力的影響。-馬歇爾：嗯，我認為50年代的時候他們相當開放。我認識許多機構人員的原因是因為他們會來到RAND。

--- 段落 250 (473 字元) ---
And they  were interested in how we got this, or what analysis we used?It’s true that once I  got into government, and had customers who were the people that I was serving  and I thought needed better analysis, then I was pressuring them and tasking  them in various ways to try to do these things.But to tell one last story: One of the things that I did for Schlesinger, that I think  I mentioned, was this business of being an intermediary to the intelligence  community.

[翻譯]
他們對我們是如何得到這些資料或使用了何種分析方法感興趣？事實上，一旦我進入政府，有了我所服務的客戶，我認為他們需要更好的分析，那麼我就會向他們施加壓力，以各種方式要求他們嘗試進行這些事情。但最後告訴一個故事：我為施萊辛格做的一件事，就是我提到過的，就是成為情報界的中間人。

--- 段落 251 (456 字元) ---
I mentioned my work with regard to the Soviet military burden and  the cost of their military programs, but another case was this thing that flared up  about Somalia.The Russians appeared to be taking over the use of this airfield  and they had some ships tied up in the nearby port.The airfield was very close  to the seashore, and they probably had missiles in there; they were constructing  some buildings that looked like they might house the missiles.

[翻譯]
我提到了蘇聯軍事負擔和軍事計劃成本的相關工作，但另一個案例是關於索馬里的事情。俄羅斯人似乎在接管這個機場的使用權，他們在附近的港口有一些船隻停泊。這個機場非常靠近海岸，他們可能在那裡擁有導彈；他們正在建造一些看起來可能用來存放導彈的建築物。

--- 段落 252 (377 字元) ---
72 So Schlesinger  wanted an analysis by the people at the Agency about, “What do we know about  the whole process by which the Russians go about acquiring access and the use  of facilities?Are there some general patterns?Where are they in this thing?” and  so on.So I went out there, and I think it may have even been Fritz Ermarth who  was in charge of the group I contacted.

[翻譯]
所以舒萊辛格想要機構的人對「俄羅斯人如何取得設施訪問和使用的整個過程我們知道什麼？是否有一些一般模式？他們在這件事中處於什麼位置？」進行分析。所以我出去了，我想我聯繫的組織可能甚至是弗里茨·厄瑪斯負責。

--- 段落 253 (442 字元) ---
They started asking what I thought were kind of dumb questions, like, “We could  do a better job if you could tell us what decision this is going to lead to,” and so  on.I said, “First, I’m here to tell you Schlesinger wants it.Why don’t you just do it.Secondly, listening to you I come to the conclusion that you don’t know anything about this government.There isn’t any decision that’s going to be made next Thursday or something like that.

他們開始問我一些我認為有些愚蠢的問題，比如：“如果您告訴我們這個決定將會導致什麼，我們就可以做得更好”，等等。我說：“首先，我來告訴你們，舒勒辛格想要這樣做。你們為什麼不就這樣做呢？其次，聽了你們的話，我得出的結論是，你們對這個政府一無所知。沒有什麼決定會在下星期四之類的時間做出來。”

--- 段落 254 (455 字元) ---
There’s this controversy about what the  significance of this is.Don’t you know that on issues like this there’s some kind of  complex social-cultural-political process that takes place, and these assessments  are part of an input to that process, and hopefully they make people reach conclusions that are wiser than if they don’t have this input?In any case, Schlesinger  already knows what he believes; you’re not instructing him about what he believes.

[翻譯]
這裡存在著一個關於這件事情重要性的爭議。你難道不知道在這樣的問題上，存在一種複雜的社會文化政治過程，這些評估是該過程的一部分，並希望它們讓人們得出比沒有這些評估更明智的結論嗎？無論如何，施萊辛格已經知道自己的信仰；你不是在告訴他他所信仰的是什麼。

He wants you to produce something that’s useful in this type of long-term  effort to persuade others that maybe this could be something serious that they  should pay attention to.”  
- Q2: This goes back to the cooking-the-books argument.I mean, it’s those people,  “Tell me why you want to use the thing, ostensibly so I can shape my analytic  effort, but really so that I can figure out what answer you are looking for so I can  cook the books and give you the answer.”  
- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
他希望你製作出一些對於這種長期說服他人的努力有用的東西，也許這可能是一些他們應該重視的嚴肅事情。
- Q2: 這又回到了刻意造假的爭議。我的意思是，那些人，“告訴我你為什麼想使用這個東西，表面上是為了讓我形塑我分析性的努力，但實際上是為了讓我找出你想要的答案，這樣我就能捏造數據並給你答案。”
- Marshall: 是的。

### 1973–1976

[翻譯]
1973年至1976年

### In 1973, the Watergate scandal broke out, leading to President Nixon's resignation in 1974. The Vietnam War also ended in 1973 with the fall of Saigon. In 1975, the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh, leading to the Cambodian genocide. And in 1976, the United States celebrated its Bicentennial.

--- 段落 265 (361 字元) ---
- Marshall: Let’s start now.What the intention is, is to finish off the ‘70s.I read the record of the last session.We bogged down as we were just approaching the tenure  of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.But I also looked at it from the point of  view that there are a lot of stories that are not as well organized as one might like  about general themes.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我們現在就開始吧。我們的目的是要完成‘70年代的任務。我讀了上次會議的記錄。當我們接近國防部長唐納德·拉姆斯費爾德的任期時，我們陷入了困境。但我也從這樣的角度看待這個問題，有很多故事並沒有被組織得像我們想要的一樣，關於一些主題。

--- 段落 266 (363 字元) ---
So what I thought I’d do this time is say a little bit more  about the Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger period and also try to focus  some on some major themes, then deal with Rumsfeld and Secretary of Defense  Harold Brown.Let me start by talking a little bit about the period as a whole, the ‘70s.It seems to  me that a lot of things happened in the ‘70s.

[翻譯]
所以這一次我想多談一些國防部長詹姆斯·施萊辛格時期的事情，並嘗試聚焦一些主要主題，然後再談談拉姆斯菲爾德和國防部長哈羅德·布朗。讓我先談一下整個七十年代這段時期，似乎在七十年代發生了很多事情。

--- 段落 267 (471 字元) ---
I’m not talking about events in the  world, I’m talking about me and about the shape of this office which, in effect,  was just set during that time period.At least net assessment as it currently exists  was created intellectually in that period, to a large extent.So if you’re looking at  the book, the ‘70s really looks like a period that, when you get it all fleshed out,  might end up being a couple of chapters or something like that, or more than just  one chapter.

[翻譯]
我不是在談論世界上的事件，我在談論我自己，以及在那個時間段設立的這個辦公室的形狀。至少目前存在的綜合評估在那個時期在很大程度上在思想上創造出來。所以如果你看這本書，70年代看起來真的像是一個時期，當你把所有東西都完整呈現出來時，可能最終會變成一兩章，或者不只是一章。

--- 段落 268 (500 字元) ---
I think it’s hard to do it justice, and I haven’t done enough digging  back and so on to fully reconstruct the period.The other thing about the ‘70s, as I thought about that period, and also the period  really of ‘69, because I actually thought of this as starting in the summer or fall  of ‘69… In thinking about it, what struck me about myself and what happened  is how important assuming new responsibilities was in getting one to rethink  how you really ought to think about some particular area.

[翻譯]
我認為很難做到完全公正，而且我還沒有做足夠的研究來完全重建那個時期。談到70年代，當我想到那個時期，以及69年的時期，因為我實際上認為這是從69年的夏天或秋天開始... 在思考這件事時，我對自己和發生的事情的印象是，承擔新責任對於重新考慮應該如何真正思考某個特定領域是多麼重要。

--- 段落 269 (473 字元) ---
It certainly happened  at RAND when I took over from Schlesinger to run the strategic forces program,  because it made me focus on the question, “What in the hell should RAND really  be doing?What should the program really look like?How should we be thinking about strategic forces?” And that led to this whole thing on the long-term  competition and a kind of change in paradigm of, OK, the way you really want to  look at this thing is very differently than we have been.

[翻譯]
當我接替斯萊辛格來管理戰略力量計劃時，這確實發生在蘭德公司，因為這讓我專注於問題：“蘭德公司到底應該做些什麼？計劃應該是什麼樣子？我們應該如何思考戰略力量？”這讓我思考了整個長期競爭的問題，以及一種范式轉變，認為我們對這個問題的看法應該與以往不同。

--- 段落 270 (419 字元) ---
In part, it’s a recapturing  of some style of thinking that existed at RAND at the very beginning but that had  disappeared.And partly it reflected the influence of the business policy/strategy  framework that had come up in my look at organizations and so on.Just the fact  that I had this new responsibility required me to look at that.A similar thing, I think, really happened with the whole net assessment business.

[翻譯]
在某種程度上，這是對蘭德研究所最初存在但已經消失的某種思維風格的重新捕捉。部分原因也反映了商業政策/戰略框架對我的影響，這是我在研究組織等領域時提出的。僅僅是我有這個新責任就要求我去深入研究這個問題。我認為，整個網絡評估業務也類似地發生了類似的事情。

--- 段落 271 (525 字元) ---
In  some ways, it was fortunate that during the early ‘70s, when I first went to the  National Security Council staff, the main thing that—while nominally this was called  the Net Assessment Group, and we were to start that activity or recreate something  at the NSC level—the main tasks that we really spent most of our time on, particularly Chip Pickett and I, were on the implementation of the Nixon reorganization  of the intelligence community and all that, which, in retrospect, wasn’t intellectually  very interesting.

[翻譯]
在某些方面，我在70年代初第一次進入國家安全委員會工作時算是幸運的，雖然名義上這被稱為網絡評估組，我們要在NSC層次開展這項活動，但我們真正花費大部分時間的主要任務，特別是我和Chip Pickett，是在尼克松重新組織情報社區以及其他方面的實施上，回想起來，這並不是令人感到非常有趣的智力活動。

--- 段落 272 (476 字元) ---
I learned something about how stubborn, stupid, organizations  can be, the response of the Central Intelligence Agency to all this and their total  failure to really fix anything, do anything.But that’s an observation about the world  in a certain sense.It didn’t change the way I thought about things very much.But there was this opportunity to really think a little bit at the NSC about, “Alright,  we’re supposed to do these net assessments: How should you really do these?

[翻譯]
我學到一些東西，關於這些固執、愚蠢的組織，中央情報局對此的反應以及他們完全無法真正修復任何問題，採取任何行動。但這是從某種意義上對世界的觀察。這並沒有很大程度地改變我的思維方式。但在國家安全委員會，確實有機會深入思考一下，“好吧，我們應該進行這些網絡評估：你應該如何真正進行這些評估？”

--- 段落 273 (363 字元) ---
If  these things are to be serious and people are to base some decisions on them,  how do you really do the best possible job?” So I had time, then.I think that it  could have been that, given some responsibility and somebody say the first one  has to be produced in six months, you would pull out…systems analysis and …  these models and say “Let’s do something.

[翻譯]
如果這些事情是要嚴肅對待，人們會根據它們作出一些決策，那麼你要如何做到最好？我當時有時間。我覺得，如果給予一些責任，有人說第一個必須在六個月內完成，你可能會拿出系統分析和這些模型，然後說“讓我們做些什麼”。

--- 段落 274 (384 字元) ---
” And that’s kind of intellectually respectable or acceptable to people, but may be very far from, if you’re truly serious,  what the thing ought to be like.So I think it was actually very fortunate that we  didn’t have to jump into it right away, which, as I mentioned the last time, came  about because Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird threw up all kinds of bureaucratic obstacles.

[翻譯]
這在某種程度上是在智力上可以被人們接受或尊重的，但如果你真的很認真，這可能與事實應該如何相去甚遠。所以我認為我們沒有立刻投入其中其實是很幸運的，就像我上次提到的那樣，這是因為國防部長梅爾文·萊爾德對此架起了各種官僚障礙。

--- 段落 275 (466 字元) ---
So I had time to conduct a leisurely review of the state of modeling,  which I hadn’t had much hope for anyway, but found to be dismal in offering a  real basis for anything that anybody ought to trust.74  Q2: It’s gotten so much better since then, hasn’t it?- Marshall: No, not really.And then I also had time to think about what the whole  strategy for doing these things might be.I remember also how struck I was about how people thought this was very  important.

[翻譯]
所以我有時間進行一次輕鬆的模型狀態審查，我本來對此並沒有太多希望，但發現它在提供真實可信的基礎方面令人沮喪。Q2：從那時起它有變得更好，對吧？- 馬歇爾：其實並沒有。然後我也有時間思考做這些事情的整體策略可能是什麼。我還記得人們認為這非常重要時我有多驚訝。

--- 段落 276 (371 字元) ---
And people would come around and see me.I remember, in particular,  General James Polk coming to see me.And again, right at the beginning I certainly was very interested in this notion of weaknesses as well as strengths on both  sides, and he had a lot of interesting stories about how he had operated when he  was the commander in Germany [Commander in Chief of the U.S.

[翻譯]
人們會來找我。我記得特別是詹姆斯·波爾克將軍來找我。一開始，我對雙方的弱點和優勢這個概念非常感興趣，他有很多有趣的故事，描述他在德國擔任指揮官時是如何運作的。

--- 段落 277 (490 字元) ---
Army in Europe  and Commander of the NATO Central Army Group], and had initially asked his intelligence officers to tell him about what the other people really were like and got  absolutely nothing out of it, and so he chose what was a very effective strategy  for him {…}.He sat down with the junior analysts and they told him stories about  {…} and the screwups and so on.Out of that they got educated about the kind of  things he was really interested in to base judgments on: How ready?

[翻譯]
歐洲的陸軍和北約中央陸軍集團指揮官最初要求情報官告訴他其他人究竟是什麼樣子，但一無所獲。因此，他選擇了對他非常有效的策略{...}他坐下來與初級分析師交流，他們告訴他關於{...}以及錯誤等方面的故事。通過這些交流，他得到了真正感興趣的信息來做判斷：準備情況如何？

--- 段落 278 (475 字元) ---
How trained?What were the real capabilities of these other guys?And then they used to collect  materials for him.He would come back every three months and sit down with  them and hear about all this stuff.- Q3: Was this the time of the very focused look at one {…}?Marshall: No, these were just general stories.Later we organized something like  that, again during the ‘70s, as an adjunct to the [Gen.Paul] Gorman study of tank  crew training {…} to look at things like that.

[翻譯]
他們接受了怎樣的訓練？其他人真正的能力是什麼？然後他們會為他收集資料。他每三個月回來一次，坐下來和他們討論這些事情。問題3：這是非常專注於一個特定議題的時期嗎？馬歇爾：不是，這些只是一般性的故事。後來在70年代我們再次組織類似的活動，作為[保羅將軍]戈爾曼研究坦克組訓練的附加部分，以便研究這些事情。

--- 段落 279 (474 字元) ---
At any rate, I just thought it’s, in reflection, interesting that responsibility does make one more responsible and serious.- Q3: Sometimes.- Marshall: Sometimes.- Q3: For some people.- Marshall: For some people.- Q2: Would you also say that that period on the NSC shaped how you, how you went  about conducting the business of this office over the subsequent decades… 
- Marshall: No.I don’t think so.I thought a lot about how might you go about it, I  mean intellectually.

[翻譯]
無論如何，我只是認為，反思起來，責任確實會使人更負責任和嚴肅。Q3：有時候。- 馬歇爾：有時候。- Q3：對於某些人。- 馬歇爾：對於某些人。- Q2：你是否也會說在國家安全委員會任職的那段時間塑造了您如何在接下來的幾十年裡處理這個職位的業務... - 馬歇爾：不，我不這樣認為。我考慮了很多如何去做這件事，我指的是在思想上。

--- 段落 280 (480 字元) ---
But as far as the office was concerned, that was created after  we got here.- Q2: I mean how you went about doing the business of the office.One of the things  that always struck me about this office was there was never any suspense date for  any product.The office sort of worked the product until it was good.It wasn’t like  the office had to produce one by September or January.The office weren’t driven  by the other internals within the Department…  
- Marshall: Yeah, right.

[翻譯]
但就辦公室而言，這是在我們到達後才創建的。Q2: 我是指你如何著手處理辦公室的業務。這個辦公室的一件事讓我印象深刻的是，從來沒有產品的最後期限。辦公室會持續改進產品，直到達到標準。不像辦公室必須在九月或一月生產出產品。辦公室不會被部門內的其他因素所驅使…
- Marshall: 是的，對。

--- 段落 281 (487 字元) ---
- Q2: …like, got to get an annual report out or things like that.When Jeff McKitrick  replaced Barry Watts, you said, “Take six months to read everything you can in the  office and then we’ll start talking about…” Assignments where they said take six  months and get smart as you can about these things were rare.Does that go back  to your RAND days, or your own personal thing, or do you think it was shaped in  some way by the NSC?- Marshall: No, mostly my own personal view of things.

[翻譯]
問題2：…比如，必須發布年度報告之類的事情。當傑夫·麥基特替換了巴里·瓦茨時，你說：“花六個月的時間閱讀辦公室裡的所有東西，然後我們再談論…” 他們告訴你花六個月時間，盡可能了解這些事情的任務很少。這是否源自你在RAND的經驗，還是源自你個人觀點，或者你認為它在某種程度上受到了NSC的影響？- 馬歇爾：不，這主要是我自己對事物的看法。

--- 段落 282 (450 字元) ---
Also, we’ve had the luxury  and been extraordinarily fortunate in just being allowed to do what I wanted  to do, in a sense.Of course, there were times when people asked for something  and then we did it more or less on a schedule.But my feeling was that, in the first  place, you didn’t have to update these balance assessments more than every  couple of years.Things didn’t happen, turn over, unless there was some major  new source of information.

[翻譯]
此外，我們非常幸運並且得以自由地做我想做的事情。當然，有時會有人要求做某些事情，我們會在許可的情況下按照一定的時間表進行。但我的感覺是，一般來說，你並不需要每隔幾年就更新這些平衡評估。除非有了一些重大的新資訊來源，否則事情通常不會發生變化。

--- 段落 283 (192 字元) ---
- Q2: Or the collapse of the Soviet Union or something like that.- Marshall: The other thing was that you really wanted to produce a high-quality  product, and so you took the time to do that.

[翻譯]
問2: 或者蘇聯解體或像那樣的事情。- 馬歇爾: 另一件事是你真的想要生產高質量的產品，所以你花時間來做到這一點。

--- 段落 284 (472 字元) ---
- Q3: Just following up on this business of how responsibility changes the way you  think: Was it because you were given responsibility for certain intellectual tasks  that you found yourself thinking about how to do that, or was it the fact that you  were given responsibility for managing the activities of subordinates so you had  to think about how you would break it up into tasks which people had to work  on, or both?- Marshall: No, I think it was mainly the first.

[翻譯]
問3：就負責任如何改變你的思考方式這個問題，我只是想追踪一下：是因為你負責某些智力任務，你開始思考如何做到這一點，還是因為你負責管理下屬的活動，所以你必須考慮如何將其分解成人們必須工作的任務，或兩者兼有？- 馬歇爾：不，我認為主要是第一種情況。

--- 段落 285 (449 字元) ---
- Q3: So somebody gives you a subject and said understand…  
- Marshall: Well, in the one case, the RAND thing, I was to take over this program and  looked at what people were doing.And I didn’t think that amounted to anything.Then the question was, "What should we be doing?" I wanted to determine what  a really adequate look at this would be.Then I came to this view that the way you  needed to look at it was in terms of a long-term competition.

[翻譯]
- Q3: 所以有人給了你一個主題，說明白…
- 馬歇爾：嗯，在這個情況下，RAND這個事情，我負責接手這個計劃，看了看人們正在做什麼。我覺得那沒有什麼成效。然後問題是，“我們應該做什麼？”我想確定一個真正充分的觀點，這個觀察應該是什麼。後來我得出這樣的觀點，你需要以長期競爭的角度來看待這個問題。

--- 段落 286 (449 字元) ---
Therefore, these  studies of individual choices of, you know, this new bomber, really needed to be  seen as moves in this competition, as part of the implementation of a strategy  for achieving some set of goals that you really had, and that it just shouldn’t be a  matter of a more modern and up to-date way of killing the same targets that you  had been “killing” for some while, or just a response to some change in the Soviet air defense system.

[翻譯]
因此，對於個人選擇這種新轟炸機的研究，確實需要將其視為競爭中的一步，作為實現一系列目標的策略的一部分，而不僅僅是一種更現代化和最新的殺傷相同目標的方式，或者僅僅是對蘇聯防空系統變化的回應。

--- 段落 287 (445 字元) ---
My view was that you really need to think of this thing in a  very different way, and therefore look at the decision about a bomber in terms of  the whole force and the whole strategy that you were pursuing.Of course, the fact was that, at a certain level, the U.S.never has strategies like  that.Organizations can—The Air Force, say, was committed to the bombers and  had some sense of the strategy, although it was never articulated very well.

[翻譯]
我認為您真的需要以非常不同的方式思考這件事情，因此要從整體力量和您正在追求的整體策略來看待對轟炸機的決定。當然，事實是，在某個層面上，美國從來沒有這樣的戰略。組織可以，比如說，空軍致力於轟炸機並對戰略有一定的認識，儘管這並沒有被表達得很好。

--- 段落 288 (361 字元) ---
But  my experience was that once you had articulated it that way, there were often  people—here in the Pentagon it was particularly the guys in the Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering who came from the business world—  who immediately grabbed onto that.Somebody like Dick DeLauer [Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering].

[翻譯]
但我的經驗是，一旦你以這種方式表達了這個觀點，通常會有人（在五角大樓這裡特別是來自商界的國防研究與工程總監辦公室的人）會立刻抓住這一點。像迪克·迪劉爾（國防研究與工程副部長）這樣的人。

--- 段落 289 (440 字元) ---
You talked to him about how part  of the thing that we’re doing is driving up the cost of their staying in business, and  he quickly had some of his guys do a rough calculation of the cost of the Soviet  air defense system and what you might do, what’s the next set of costs you can  impose on them.In that sense, some of the civilians, particularly these guys from  the business world, had far more the right framework for looking at this.

[翻譯]
你和他談談我們所做的一部分是如何增加他們經營成本的事情，他很快讓他的人做了蘇聯防空系統的粗略計算，以及你可能會採取什麼行動，接下來可以對他們施加什麼樣的成本。從這方面來看，一些平民，尤其是來自商業界的人，對於看待這個問題有更正確的框架。

I think it really happened in the ‘80s, but I’ll tell the story of General Lew Allen’s  [Air Force Chief of Staff, 1978–1982] reaction to the kind of competitive strategies  sorts of things.He wasn’t sure it was wise for two reasons.One was that we were  too erratic, and therefore we might start something, they would react, and then  we wouldn’t continue on to the next stage, and we’d be worse off than if we’d  not done anything, which is quite plausible.

[翻譯]
我想這件事確實發生在80年代，但我要講一下對於類似競爭性策略的事情，將軍Lew Allen（美國空軍參謀長，1978年至1982年任職）的反應。他認為有兩點原因不確定這樣做是否明智。一個原因是我們太不穩定，因此我們可能會開始某件事，他們會做出反應，然後我們就無法繼續進行下一階段，我們最後會比不做任何事情更糟，這是很有可能的。

On the other hand, his view was that  the costs are meaningless to them.It’s as though they had infinite resources and  there was no sense that they…It was as though…  
- Q3: There weren’t opportunity costs.- Marshall: Yeah.His view suggested that in socialist countries there are no opportunity costs.They can always just go ahead and put more resources in, and there’s  no pain and nothing ever happened.

[翻譯]
另一方面，他認為成本對他們來說毫無意義。就像他們擁有無限的資源一樣，沒有任何感覺…好像…  
- Q3：沒有機會成本。- 馬歇爾：是的。他的觀點認為在社會主義國家中不存在機會成本。他們可以隨時投入更多資源，而且不會有痛苦和任何後果。

--- 段落 292 (473 字元) ---
Whereas other people have a sense of, “No,  they have limited resources, too, and there are consequences,” and so on.OK.So let me then talk about the ‘70s and what are some of the interesting  themes to me, from the intellectual side of things, apart from this whole invention  of net assessment.The thing that strikes me the most is the constant interest in, going back to this  business of perceptions, concern for the calculations and perspectives of the  other players.

[翻譯]
然而，其他人則會認為，“不，他們資源有限，也會有後果”等等。好的。那我接下來談談70年代對我來說一些有趣的主題，除了整個網絡評估的發明之外，從性質的角度。最讓我印象深刻的是對其他玩家觀點、計算和觀點的持續關注。

--- 段落 293 (443 字元) ---
As I mentioned last time, that came out of interest that Schlesinger  and I had at RAND, triggered by reading, at least initially, and I think for both of us,  Robert Ardrey’s The Territorial Imperative, and interest in, essentially, the peacetime aspects or uses of military power.75 One of the things that struck me and  struck him was that almost all the analysis about military forces goes into the war  and how the fighting might be done.

[翻譯]
正如我上次提到的，這源於我們在蘭德研究所對施萊辛格和我感興趣，最初是受到羅伯特·阿德里的《領土本能》啟發，我認為對我們兩人來說興趣在於軍事力量的和平時期方面或用途。其中一件讓我感到震撼的事情也讓他感到震撼的是，幾乎所有關於軍事力量的分析都是關於戰爭以及如何進行戰鬥。

--- 段落 294 (380 字元) ---
While people use words like “presence” and  have some general sense that, yes, it’s better to be strong than to be weak and  things like that, there’s very little analysis of this matter.In particular, Schlesinger  was very interested in the question of, “alright, these things are going on, How do  you do well at it?What actions, what ways of demonstration really are effective?

[翻譯]
雖然人們常使用「存在感」等詞語並大致感覺到，是的，強大比較弱小更好之類的事情，但對這個問題的分析非常少。特別是，施萊辛格對這個問題非常感興趣，“好吧，這些事情正在發生，你該如何做得好呢？哪些行動，哪些表現方式真正有效呢？

--- 段落 295 (489 字元) ---
” And then it spills over into the whole area of deception and many other things,  like Henry Kissinger’s and Richard Nixon’s views on crises as opportunities as well  as problems.Even before I got to the Pentagon, when I was working for Kissinger I tried to get  the intelligence people to do some analyses, as best they could, of the Russians  and what they pay attention to about us.What things get us good scores in their  books as against things that get us bad or indifferent scores?

[翻譯]
然後這就延伸到欺騙等許多其他事情的整個範疇，就像亨利·基辛格和理查德·尼克松對危機的看法，視之為機會和問題。即使在我進入五角大廈之前，當我還在為基辛格工作時，我試圖讓情報人員根據俄羅斯人對我們關注的內容進行一些分析，他們對我們哪些方面印象好，哪些方面印象不好或不在意？

--- 段落 296 (345 字元) ---
And you know, you  come up with some interesting things.Then later, there are still other developments, and you even get into issues of the prestige effects of reaching the moon  and all of that.76  But clearly this theme of perceptions and the peacetime uses of military power is  something that runs through a lot of what was done in the ‘70s.

[翻譯]
你知道，你提出了一些有趣的想法。後來，還有其他的發展，甚至涉及到太空競賽對聲望的影響等議題。但顯然，這種感知和和平時期利用軍事力量的主題貫穿了70年代的很多研究。

--- 段落 297 (390 字元) ---
The second thing is this long-term competition perspective, and in the beginning  and in the middle ‘70s, in particular, this writing of various things on actual strategy or strategic planning sorts of things for Rumsfeld and for Brown, which, again,  brought back in a lot of these economic dimensions of things, and led to the  creation of the Investment Balance and some of these things.

[翻譯]
第二個重點是這個長期競爭的觀點，在開始和70年代中期特別是，寫了一些關於拉姆斯菲爾德和布朗實際戰略或戰略規劃方面的東西，再次帶回了許多經濟方面的因素，並導致投資平衡和一些其他事項的產生。

--- 段落 298 (398 字元) ---
Those two things,  plus all the things that get into the development of net assessment, are the main  intellectual things, I think.Let me just talk briefly about the Schlesinger period, to pick up some things that  I think didn’t come through clear enough during the last talk.This was a period,  really, of the development of the state of the art of doing these things.We had the  time to do them.

[翻譯]
這兩件事情，再加上參與網絡評估發展的所有事情，是我認為最主要的智力活動。讓我簡要談談舒萊辛格時期，提到上次講話中我認為沒有講清楚的一些事情。這個時期真的是發展這些事情的藝術水準的時期。我們有時間做這些事情。

--- 段落 299 (474 字元) ---
Soon after I got here, Schlesinger and I talked, and there were  these three areas that I mentioned last time.He was interested in assessments on  the strategic balance, the NATO-Warsaw Pact balance, and the maritime balance.We started to work on that, and made, I think, the least progress on the strategic  balance.I also did a bunch of special things for Schlesinger.It also was after I got here that we changed the nature of the task, in some sense,  for net assessment.

[翻譯]
我抵達這裡不久後，與施萊辛格見面，我提到了上次提過的三個領域。他對戰略平衡、北約-華沙條約平衡和海上平衡的評估很感興趣。我們開始著手進行工作，在戰略平衡方面取得的進展應該是最少的。我還為施萊辛格做了一些特殊的事情。也就是在我到達這裡後，我們改變了對淨評估的任務性質。

--- 段落 300 (450 字元) ---
That is, up till that time we were tasking the people in the  Pentagon to do assessments from the NSC, because that’s the way it was thought  that it would be done.They were broad, general studies with many participants  and task forces, which ended up—I came here before the first one was finished—  with these brokered, bullshit analyses; you know, “the Soviets don’t have any  weaknesses” nonsense out of the Defense Intelligence Agency and so on.

[翻譯]
換句話說，直到那個時候，我們讓五角大樓的人從國家安全委員會做評估，因為大家都認為應該這樣做。這些評估是廣泛的、涉及眾多參與者和工作小組的研究，最後我在第一輪評估完成前就來到這裡了。這些評估結果是通過斡旋達成的、鬧劇一樣的分析；你知道的，“蘇聯沒有任何弱點”之類的廢話出自國防情報局等。

--- 段落 301 (314 字元) ---
After  we had finished off that first one, Schlesinger’s attitude was, to put it in his way  of speaking, “Enough of this shit.Let’s get on and do something serious.” So the  whole thing then became that these were private assessments sent to him, and  he read them, and he would then pass them on if he wanted to.

[翻譯]
完成了第一件事後，施萊辛格的態度是，用他的方式來說，“這種狗屁事夠了，我們該做些嚴肅的事情了。”所以整個事情就變成這些是私人評估發送給他的，他會閱讀它們，如果他想要，他會轉發它們。

--- 段落 302 (266 字元) ---
The fact was that  we were still learning how to do it, so we didn’t have a lot of really great things to  offer him, because of start-up times and the fact that once you started, you found  that none of the right data existed, and all that.So we weren’t so helpful.

[翻譯]
事實是我們仍在學習如何做這件事，所以我們並沒有太多真正出色的東西可以提供給他，因為起步時間較長，而且一旦開始了，你會發現並不存在正確的數據，所有這些。所以我們並沒有提供太多幫助。

--- 段落 303 (420 字元) ---
Another thing I spent a lot of time on was serving as an intermediary for him with  the intelligence community, trying to get special studies, special assessments  done, trying to get them to look again and see whether they wouldn’t find some different answers to things like the military burden of the Soviet Union and some  things of that sort.77  But basically, the whole way of doing things began to take shape then.

[翻譯]
另一件我花了很多時間做的事情是充當他與情報界之間的中介，試圖進行特別研究、特別評估，試圖讓他們重新檢視，看是否可以找到不同的答案，像是蘇聯的軍事負擔等等。但基本上，整個工作方式開始形成那時。

--- 段落 304 (450 字元) ---
Certainly the avoidance of models, the reliance on judgment, the importance of data  on long-term trends and asymmetries, the importance of really understanding  the other side’s doctrine and concepts, which would be a major aspect of the  asymmetries, were all part of the net assessment approach.As I mentioned, there  was a lot of attention to the psychological-political effects or uses of military  forces.And it wasn’t just the military forces.

[翻譯]
當然，避免依賴模型，依靠判斷，重視長期趨勢和不對稱數據，真正理解對方的學說和概念的重要性，將是不對稱因素的主要方面，都是網絡評估方法的一部分。正如我所提到的，對軍事力量的心理政治效應或使用受到了很大的關注。而且這不僅僅是對軍事力量。

--- 段落 305 (335 字元) ---
For example, when Schlesinger was  Secretary, it became the U.S.’s turn to host one of these big, formal NATO meetings [Nuclear Planning Group meeting, 17 Jun 1975].78 In discussion with him,  we decided that… Again, one of the things your forces do is not just impress the  enemy, but your allies.Well, it’s not even just your forces.

[翻譯]
例如，當舒萊辛格擔任國務卿時，輪到美國主辦這些重要的正式北約會議[核規劃小組會議，1975年6月17日]。在和他討論後，我們決定...再者，你的部隊所做的一件事情不僅僅是給敵人留下深刻印象，也包括你的盟友。嗯，甚至不僅僅是你的部隊。

--- 段落 306 (496 字元) ---
So we consciously chose  to hold the meeting in California, so that the defense ministers and other allied  officials could fly across the whole country, because most of these people never  get beyond Washington.And so it’s held at the Naval Postgraduate School, which  I knew had appropriate facilities.And then they were taken down one day to the  missile-launching sites and tours of the silos at Vandenberg Air Force Base and  things of that sort.All, in part, based on bucking up the allies.

[翻譯]
因此，我們有意選擇在加利福尼亞州舉行會議，這樣國防部長和其他盟國官員就可以穿越整個國家飛到那裡，因為這些人中的大多數從未離開華盛頓。所以會議在海軍研究生院舉行，我知道那裡有適當的設施。然後他們被安排一天參觀范登堡空軍基地的導彈發射基地和地下金庫等等。所有這些部分都是為了支持盟友。

--- 段落 307 (316 字元) ---
So Schlesinger was  very interested in all of these dimensions, as I was.- Q3: Did you get any feedback?- Marshall: No, it’s hard to know.I don’t know, it didn’t, I think…I even found a Robinson Jeffers poem for Schlesinger to use in his speech at this meeting.At any rate,  he was very, very interested in all that.

[翻譯]
因此，Schlesinger 對所有這些層面都非常感興趣，我也是。問題3：您有任何反饋嗎？馬歇爾：沒有，很難知道。我不知道，我想……我甚至為Schlesinger找到了一首羅賓遜·傑佛斯的詩，讓他在這次會議上使用。無論如何，他對這一切都非常非常感興趣。

--- 段落 308 (365 字元) ---
Another thing that we did along this line, I mean while we were thinking a lot  about the Soviets, how they score us, how they see us—again to follow up on  the business of the allies—I undertook, with Nathan Leites’s help, to try to find  out, If we’re going to try to impress the allies as well as the Russians, what do they  notice?What do they pay attention to?

[翻譯]
在這條路線上，我們另一個做的事情是，在我們密切關注蘇聯，考慮他們如何評價我們、如何看待我們的同時，我們又去深入探討盟友的問題。在內森·萊特斯（Nathan Leites）的幫助下，我著手試圖找出，如果我們要向盟友和俄羅斯人留下印象，他們會注意到什麼？他們關注什麼？

--- 段落 309 (407 字元) ---
I used my connections into the French to  talk with them and found some interesting things, which wasthat what appeared  to weigh very highly with them, because of the importance of their own nuclear submarines to them, was essentially antisubmarine warfare, in the sense of  who was ahead in that.That seemed to get very big weight.Nathan went off to  interview the British, and the Germans, in particular.

[翻譯]
我利用我與法國人的聯繫進行交談，發現一些有趣的事情。他們似乎十分重視的是他們自己的核潛艇的重要性，基本上是反潛戰，也就是在這方面誰領先。對他們來說這似乎非常重要。Nathan 前去掉訪英國人，尤其是德國人。

--- 段落 310 (438 字元) ---
79 Then subsequently, he  did another thing on Germany, which we had to circumscribe all publication of,  because, in essence, it said it is very doubtful that the Germans will actually fight.But Nathan had some very keen insights into the Germans.80  
- Q3: Is this the time when he came up with this image of “pygmies, midgets, and  giants?”  
- Marshall: No, that was just verbally.That antedates this, I think.It goes back to…  Right.

[翻譯]
79 然後隨後，他對德國做了另一件事，我們不得不限制所有發表，因為實質上它表示德國人實際上可能不會戰鬥。但是內森對德國人有一些非常敏銳的見解。  
- Q3: 這是他提出“矮人、侏儒和巨人”形象的時候嗎？  
- 馬歇爾： 不是，那只是口頭上講的。我想那是早於這個時間，它回溯到... 對，是的。

--- 段落 311 (488 字元) ---
The other thing that had a big impact as far as the office was concerned, I  think, was that we got a reasonable start on getting funding for studies through  the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and through the Defense Nuclear  Agency.Again, one of the things that happened during this time was that Don Cotter was here and wanted to do various kind of studies, and Pete Haas [Deputy  Director for Science and Technology] of DNA came around and asked what they  could do for me.

[翻譯]
就辦公室而言，另一件對我們產生重大影響的事情是，我們開始透過國防部高級研究計劃局和國防核能機構獲得研究資金方面取得了合理的進展。在這段時間內發生的另一件事是唐·科特（Don Cotter）在此，並希望進行各種研究，DNA的科技副總監皮特·哈斯（Pete Haas）也來找我詢問他們能為我做些什麼。

--- 段落 312 (288 字元) ---
That was, in part, what he would have done anyway, but it also,  I’m sure, was seen as something they could use to then get me to authorize or  request DNA to do things that it wanted to for Cotter, but that Cotter didn’t necessarily have the authority or the right portfolio to get into.

[翻譯]
這在某種程度上本來就是他會做的事情，但我相信，對他們來說也被視為可以讓他們讓我授權或要求DNA做他們想要為Cotter做的事情，但Cotter不一定有權力或權利組合進行。

--- 段落 313 (464 字元) ---
For example, Cotter was  very interested in this whole business of analyzing Soviet exercises in Europe, and  in the conventional aspects of that as well as the nuclear, but given his portfolio, it  was hard for him to get into that and hard for DNA to get into it.- Q2: Where was he?- Marshall: He was the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy.- Q2: AE?- Marshall: AE, yeah.But Net Assessment had the virtue that we could use them for  anything.

[翻譯]
例如，科特對分析蘇聯在歐洲進行的演習很感興趣，包括常規方面和核武方面，但鑑於他的職務範圍，很難讓他參與其中，也很難讓國家核安全局（DNA）參與其中。- Q2：他在哪裡？- 馬歇爾：他是國防部原子能助理。- Q2：原子能？- 馬歇爾：對，是原子能。但是綜合評估局有一個優勢，就是我們可以讓他們參與任何事情。

--- 段落 314 (434 字元) ---
We could say, “We want you to do those things.” So a lot of that was done.But pretty much from the beginning, we got a fair amount of money, and that got us  into this pattern of extensive contracting for outside work, which was very important,  particularly in some of these cases where you didn’t believe the CIA answers to a lot of  questions.You’d go get somebody intelligent to look at those questions.OK.Let’s go on to Rumsfeld.

[翻譯]
我們可以說，“我們希望你做這些事情。” 所以很多事情都做了。但從一開始，我們就得到了相當多的錢，這讓我們進入了大量外包工作的模式，這對於一些情況非常重要，特別是在你不相信CIA對很多問題的答案時。你會找一個聰明的人來看那些問題。好的，讓我們繼續談談拉姆斯菲爾德。

--- 段落 315 (476 字元) ---
Rumsfeld came in around late November or early December of ‘75 [20 Nov 1975].He was here during ‘76, so he was here just for essentially a  little over one year.I was very impressed with Rumsfeld.I think, in fact, in some ways,  of all the people I’ve worked for, that he was potentially the best Secretary of Defense.- Q2: That’s a lot of people.I mean, that’s pretty…  
- Marshall: I think that because of his political skills and ability and interest in using  good people.

[翻譯]
盧姆斯菲爾德大約在1975年11月底或12月初到任。他在1976年期間都在這裡，所以他只在這裡待了一年多一點。我對盧姆斯菲爾德印象非常深刻。我覺得，事實上，在我曾經服務過的所有領導人中，他有可能是最優秀的國防部長。- Q2：這樣的人數真的很多。我是說，這相當…- 馬歇爾：我認為是因為他的政治技巧、能力和對利用優秀人才的興趣。

--- 段落 316 (472 字元) ---
Schlesinger, of course, was a close friend of mine, but he scared too  many people.People were frightened of him.I told the story last time that when  he was the Director of Central Intelligence, a large part of the middle management hid from him out at CIA.He and I always got along terrifically, but lots of  people were just frightened of him.- Q3: He was on a visiting committee for a Harvard thing and he had the same effect  at Harvard.People were terrorized—“Oh no!

[翻譯]
謝西爾辛格當然是我一個親密的朋友，但他嚇壞了太多人。人們對他感到害怕。我上次講過一個故事，當他擔任中央情報局局長時，許多中層管理人員都躲避他。他和我總是相處得很好，但很多人只是害怕他。他曾經參加哈佛一個委員會，對哈佛也有同樣的影響。人們都感到恐懼 - 「哦，不要！」

--- 段落 317 (402 字元) ---
We’re going to have to give…  Schlesinger is going to be there and he is going say some goddam thing and  we’re not going to know what to say.”  
- Marshall: Yeah.- Q2: Of course that’s true.- Q3: Yes.I got along fine with him.- Marshall: He and I got to be very close at RAND.And there was a set of people that  he dealt with, Cotter and others.But kind of the ordinary bureaucrat was just  terrified.

[翻譯]
我們將不得不給予...施萊辛格（Schlesinger）會在那裡，他會說一些該死的話，而我們卻不知道該說什麼。- 馬歇爾（Marshall）：是的。- Q2：當然是真的。- Q3：是的。我和他相處得很好。- 馬歇爾：在蘭德（RAND）時，他和我關係非常密切。還有一群他交往的人，科特爾（Cotter）和其他人。但對一般的官僚來說，他們只是感到恐懼。

--- 段落 318 (445 字元) ---
- Q2: So you think that it was Rumsfeld’s bureaucratic and organizational, people  skills… 
- Marshall: Yeah, that’s right.He seemed also, as I say, to use people extraordinarily  well, all kinds of people.And then he also was politically astute, you know.But he  didn’t have a long stay.He largely left us alone, except that he would make requests, I mean when there  was some question or some issue that he was interested in or concerned with.

[翻譯]
Q2：所以你認為是拉姆斯菲爾德的官僚和組織能力，還有人際技巧...
Marshall：是的，沒錯。正如我所說，他似乎非常擅長運用各種人才。而且他也很有政治敏感度。但他並沒有長時間留下來。除非是在某個他感興趣或關心的問題或議題上，他通常會讓我們自己做，只是偶爾會提出要求。

--- 段落 319 (446 字元) ---
He had some questions, I remember, about the strategic balance and what did I  think, or the nature of deterrence, or something like that, and I would write him a  paper.We also created some short, four- or five-page assessments, kind of summary stuff.But basically we were left alone and we went ahead and did that.The other thing that impressed me about him was that he had this kind of strategic sense of, “Let’s think about where we’re going.

[翻譯]
我記得他有一些問題，關於戰略平衡或我認為的事情，或者是威慑的本質之類的，然後我會給他寫一篇論文。我們也製作了一些短小的、四至五頁的評估，類似總結的東西。但基本上我們是獨立操作，繼續向前做。另一件讓我印象深刻的事情是，他有這種戰略意識：“讓我們想一想我們要去的地方”。

--- 段落 320 (465 字元) ---
” And he tried to do something  for the Navy, on the naval programs.I remember he asked for a paper overnight.Jim Roche and I prepared something that he liked a lot.I can remember the  meeting that took place.It was on a Saturday morning.Rumsfeld had a bunch of  people in.And an Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation guy got up to talk  about things and was going on and obviously had no sense at all about what kind  of perspective Rumsfeld was interested in.

[翻譯]
他試圖為海軍做些事情，就海軍計劃而言。我記得他曾要求隔夜準備文件。吉姆·羅奇和我準備了一些他很喜歡的東西。我還記得那次會議。那是在一個星期六早上。朗斯菲爾德邀請了一群人。一位辦公室程序分析和評估的人起身發言，談論事情，但顯然完全不知道朗斯菲爾德感興趣的視角是什麼。

--- 段落 321 (459 字元) ---
So about half way through the thing, Rumsfeld says, “Why don’t we stop looking  at our shoelaces and raise our sights and see where we are going.”  
- Q3: This is an example of not scaring people…  
- Marshall: And it was because of that, that and our own interests, that Roche and  I wrote this July ‘76 thing, saying, “What would a strategy for defense really look  like?How would you organize it, using business analogies of, What ‘businesses’  are you in?

[翻譯]
所以大約在進行中途，倫斯菲爾德說，"我們為什麼不停止低頭看鞋帶，提高我們的視野，看清我們要去哪裡。"
- Q3：這是一個不嚇人的例子...
- 馬歇爾：正是因為這個原因，以及出於我們自身的利益，羅奇和我在1976年7月寫了這篇文章，說，“防禦的戰略真正應該是什麼樣子呢？你如何組織它，使用商業類比，你在做什麼‘生意’？”

--- 段落 322 (351 字元) ---
What are you trying to do in that ‘business?’ What are the major trends  and other things that you ought to take account of in thinking about that part of  the ‘business?’” That’s how we got into doing something beyond the more narrow  assessment.That carried over later, which we will get to, to Brown, who was also  interested in this kind of thing.

[翻譯]
你在那個「業務」中試圖做什麼？在考慮該部分「業務」時，應該考慮哪些主要趨勢和其他事情？這就是我們如何開始超出更狹窄的評估範圍。這種做法後來延續到布朗身上，他也對這種事情感興趣。

--- 段落 323 (351 字元) ---
In fact, while we wrote this thing for Rumsfeld,  that is the July ‘76 thing, and he looked at it and responded favorably, Jimmy  Carter came in as President and there wasn’t much time to do anything about it.Then we sent it to Harold Brown, and he liked it, and then we did some strategic  planning experiments for him.81 And we’ll get to that later.

[翻譯]
事實上，當我們為拉姆斯菲爾德寫這件事情時，也就是1976年7月的事情，他看了並作出了正面回應，但是卻換了吉米·卡特成了總統，我們沒有太多時間去做任何事情。然後我們把它送給了哈羅德·布朗，他喜歡這個想法，然後我們替他做了一些戰略規劃實驗，我們後面會再提到。

--- 段落 324 (337 字元) ---
The other interesting thing that happened during the Rumsfeld period was the  start of this strategic dialogue with the Israelis, which ran from April of ‘76 through  about 1980.82 The Israelis had approached Schlesinger twice.He may have been  approached through other things, but I knew of two approaches because they  came through me.

[翻譯]
在朗斯菲爾德時期發生的另一件有趣的事情是從1976年4月開始，持續到1980年左右的這場與以色列人的戰略對話。以色列人兩次接觸了施萊辛格。他可能是通過其他途徑接觸的，但我知道有兩次接觸是通過我這裡來的。

--- 段落 325 (455 字元) ---
Something else which is worth mentioning about the Schlesinger period was that  shortly after I got here—I came here right after the Israeli-Arab War, Yom Kippur  War—Schlesinger put me in charge of a quickie “lessons learned” effort.Each of  the Services was going to undertake a much longer term, thorough effort, and  the Joint Staff ran off and did something, but he wanted an effort to try to get  any lessons learned that could be useful in any way.

[翻譯]
值得一提的是，施萊辛格時期的另一個重要事情是，在我來這裡不久之後-我是在以色列阿拉伯戰爭、贖罪日戰爭之後來到這裡的-施萊辛格讓我負責一個快速的“經驗教訓”工作。每個軍種都將進行一項更長期、更徹底的工作，聯合參謀會做一些工作，但他希望通過一項努力，嘗試獲得任何可能有用的教訓。

--- 段落 326 (402 字元) ---
So we organized an effort,  and I borrowed Tony Cordesman from ARPA to go over there and gather materials and so on.And we had tried to send S.L.A.Marshall there.He made a quickie trip  and talked to the Israeli military that he knew best, came back, wrote something.Schlesinger liked him a lot and wanted to send him back in, but then the Israelis  wouldn’t let him back in the country.- Q2: Jeez.Why?

[翻譯]
所以我們組織了一個工作小組，並向阿帕爾借來東尼·科德斯曼，讓他去那裡收集材料等等。我們曾試圖派遣 S.L.A. 馬歇爾去那裡。他進行了一次快速的旅行，與他最熟悉的以色列軍方進行了交談，回來後撰寫了一些東西。施萊辛格很喜歡他，想再次派他去，但是以色列人不讓他再進入該國。- 問題2：天哪，為什麼？

--- 段落 327 (365 字元) ---
- Marshall: The basic reason was, I think, that… Look, from the Israeli point of view,  that war was very traumatic, because it showed up deficiencies in their planning,  in their thinking.So there was a big internal quarrel in Israel afterwards.There was  this big investigation.I forget the name of that commission that they set up.- Q3: Agranat?- Marshall: Yeah.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我認為，基本原因是...看，從以色列的角度來看，那場戰爭非常具有創傷性，因為它暴露了他們計劃和思維上的缺陷。所以後來在以色列內部引發了一場大爭議。他們進行了一場大調查。我忘記他們成立的那個委員會的名字了。- Q3: Agarnat？- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 328 (419 字元) ---
So it was very controversial, and Marshall probably was most associated with one of the factions, and so they didn’t want him back in the country.So we couldn’t get him to do it, so we organized this other effort and, as I say, put  Cordesman on it.When Cordesman came back, he relayed this request by the Israelis that they  wanted to set up a direct channel between the Ministry of Defense and the Defense Department.

因此，這是非常具爭議性的，馬歇爾可能與其中一個派系最有關聯，因此他們不希望他回到該國。因此，我們無法讓他參與，所以我們組織了另一個行動，就像我說的，讓科德斯曼參與其中。當科德斯曼回來時，他傳達了以色列方面的請求，他們希望建立以色列國防部和美國國防部之間的直接聯繫渠道。

We found out later, I think, that part of it was related to the fact  that they did not trust their ambassador here [Simcha Dinitz], who they felt was  interfering with the appropriate discussions between the two military establishments.Schlesinger checked with Kissinger, who was at State, and the thing was  kind of vetoed.I don’t think Schlesinger was strongly tempted anyway, and it was  a little unspecific as to what they wanted.There was a similar kind of request that  happened later.

[翻譯]
我們後來發現，我想，其中一部分與他們不信任他們在這裡的大使[辛卡·迪尼茨]有關，他們覺得他正在干預兩個軍事機構之間的適當討論。舒萊辛格向基辛格查證，基辛格當時在國務院，事情被否決了。我不認為舒萊辛格真心想這樣做，而且他們要求的內容有點不具體。之後又發生了類似的請求。

--- 段落 330 (194 字元) ---
But after Schlesinger had left and Rumsfeld was already on board, a man named  Saadia Amiel came to see me, and he saw other people, again requesting the  establishment of this kind of dialogue.

[翻譯]
但在舒萊辛格離開後，拉姆斯菲爾德已經上任後，一位名叫薩迪亞·阿米爾的人來找我，他見過其他人，再次要求建立這種對話。

--- 段落 331 (490 字元) ---
In the aftermath of the ‘73 war, the Israelis  were trying to create more of an Office of the Secretary of Defense-like structure  to both oversee the forces, but also they became aware—well, it goes back to the  ‘67 war, when the French had cut them off after having been their main supplier—that they were beginning to do more of their own weaponry, and, I guess,  after the ‘73 war, they decided they needed to do more thinking, planning in  order to decide what they ought to invest in.

[翻譯]
在‘73年戰爭結束後，以色列人試圖建立更像國防部長辦公室的結構，以監督軍隊，同時他們意識到—這可以追溯到‘67戰爭，當時法國切斷了他們作為主要供應商後，他們開始自行生產更多武器，我猜在‘73戰爭之後，他們決定需要更多思考和計劃，以決定他們應該投資在什麼方面。

--- 段落 332 (432 字元) ---
So Amiel came by, and again I kind of put him off, but he finally convinced Deputy  Secretary of Defense Robert Ellsworth that some such interchange should take  place.Rumsfeld agreed, and I was asked to be the point of contact for doing this.They wanted to keep these discussions out of any forum which the Israelis could  use to argue for, you know, “What about the $200 million we asked for?” “Where’s  the shipment of so and so?

[翻譯]
於是阿米爾來訪了，我再次有點推遲了，但最後他成功說服國防部副部長羅伯特·艾爾斯沃思，認為應該進行某種交流。羅姆斯菲爾德同意了，我被要求成為進行這項工作的聯絡人。他們希望將這些討論保持在以色列無法用來主張的任何論壇之外，你知道，“我們要求的兩億美元呢？” “那些東西的運送到哪裡了？”

--- 段落 333 (488 字元) ---
” So it was explicitly understood that this was not to  be a forum for any of that.It was to be a discussion with them, and also in some  ways a channel for advice to them, as to how they ought to think about their own  future, and do a better job of planning and so on.Also, the thing was to be kept  very quiet.And in fact, no one knew about this, which was a problem, because  the people who nominally do all the relations with the Israelis, got their nose got  out of joint and so on.

[翻譯]
因此，人們明確了解這不是一個討論這些事情的論壇。這是一個與他們討論的地方，同時也是向他們提供建議的渠道，告訴他們應該如何思考自己的未來，更好地規劃等等。另外，這件事情要保持極度的祕密。實際上，沒有人知道這件事，這是一個問題，因為名義上負責與以色列人打交道的人感到不滿。

--- 段落 334 (452 字元) ---
But initially, we had a kind of cover for doing it, which was, “We’re going there just to get information.”  
- Q2: So State Department did not approve that?- Marshall: I don’t know whether that was ever checked with State.I have no idea.But when Brown came in, he was told about this.The thing was done on a basis  of twice a year, and by that time, they came here in April of ‘76 and we went there  in September, October, something like that, of ‘76.

[翻譯]
但最初，我們有一種偽裝的藉口，即“我們只是去那裡獲取資訊。”
- Q2: 那國務院沒有批准這個嗎？- 馬歇爾：我不知道是否有向國務院查證過這件事。我毫不知情。但當布朗上任後，他被告知了這件事情。這件事是以每年兩次的頻率進行的，到了那個時候，他們在1976年4月來到這裡，我們在1976年9月或10月左右去了那裡。

--- 段落 335 (417 字元) ---
In the Carter Administration,  Brown then asked about it, and he, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, and Assistant  to the President for National Security Affairs Zbigniew Brzezinski knew about it  and were the only… And we would send him reports of the discussions.And, I  don’t know, I presume he told them, at some breakfast meetings or something  like that, about things.- Q2: Who within the Defense Department knew?

[翻譯]
在卡特政府中，布朗隨後詢問了這件事，他、國務卿賽勒斯·范斯和國家安全事務助理日比斯基·布热津斯基知道這件事，並且是唯一知道的人...我們會向他發送討論報告。而且，我不知道，我推測他在一些早餐會議之類的場合告訴了他們一些事情。- Q2: 在國防部內部有哪些人知道？

--- 段落 336 (478 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, people then sort of knew it was happening, but they got none of  the reports.- Q2: They didn’t know what it was?- Marshall: They sort of knew what it was, but they didn’t… It ended in the last year  of the Carter Administration because Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs David McGiffert and company couldn’t stand it any longer,  that is, to be excluded.- Q2: How’s the intelligence community play on that?- Marshall: Not at all.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：嗯，那時人們有點知道正在發生的事情，但他們沒有得到任何報告。- Q2：他們不知道那是什麼嗎？- 馬歇爾：他們有點知道那是什麼，但他們沒有...在卡特政府最後一年結束，因為國防部國際安全事務助理部長大衛·麥吉弗特（David McGiffert）和他的同事再也無法忍受被排除在外的情況。- Q2：情報界在這方面起什麼作用嗎？- 馬歇爾：完全沒有。

--- 段落 337 (394 字元) ---
- Q2: None of them involved, they got none of the reports, they never saw you over  there talking to the Israelis and wondered, “What the hell?”  
- Marshall: Well, the attachés knew we were over there, and they would hear something about it.What they reported, I don’t know.We didn’t pay much attention to  that.The ambassador there we would talk to; during part of the time it was Sam  Lewis.

[翻譯]
Q2：他們當中沒有人參與，他們沒有得到任何報告，也沒看到你在那裡跟以色列人交談，不禁疑惑：“到底發生了什麼？”
馬歇爾：欸，那些外交官知道我們在那邊，他們可能聽到了一些消息。至於他們報告了什麼，我不清楚。我們並沒有太在意這些。我們會和那裡的大使交談；在一段時間裡是山姆·路易斯。

--- 段落 338 (445 字元) ---
My counterpart, initially—I forget the man’s name, a guy who was a special  assistant to Shimon Peres, who was the defense minister when the thing started,  and had been the ambassador to France, and then later when the Likud came in,  was the Deputy Minister of Defense, and his name was Mordechai…Zippori.So at any rate, there isn’t too much to say, as I say, about the Rumsfeld period, I  think, as far as interests that continued to develop.

[翻譯]
我的對應人員，起初-我忘了那個男人的名字，他是西蒙·佩雷斯的特別助手，當事情開始時，他是國防部長，後來成為駐法國大使，後來利科德黨上臺後，他成為國防副部長，他的名字是莫德開...希波利。無論如何，關於拉姆斯菲爾德時期，我想說的並不多，就我所知，興趣並沒有持續發展。

- Q1: Did you begin working for Henry Kissinger because he and President Nixon  were dissatisfied with the National Intelligence Estimates they were receiving?- Marshall: [Name of person unclear] and Mitchell conveyed the same comments  about the NIEs.It happened before I got involved.What I was told by Kissinger  was that shortly after the Administration was in place, Nixon had read a few NIEs.He thought they were poor.

[翻譯]
問1：您是因為亨利·基辛格和尼克松總統對他們收到的國家情報估計感到不滿才開始為他工作的嗎？- 馬歇爾：[無法確定人名]和米切爾表達了相同的意見。這是在我參與之前的事情。基辛格告訴我的是，就在政府上任後不久，尼克松閱讀了一些國家情報估計。他認為它們很差。

--- 段落 341 (473 字元) ---
He thought they were much worse than the ones he  remembered from when he had been the vice president—I don’t know whether  that’s really true.At any rate, he was greatly dissatisfied.So, he got Mitchell and  Kissinger to kind of look at things.And I think the three of them had a meeting to  compare notes on, “OK, what’s wrong with these things.Why don’t we like them?”  And that was one of the outstanding complaints—this lack of the separation of  the fact and opinion.

[翻譯]
他覺得這些事情比他擔任副總統時記憶中的更糟糕 - 我不知道這是否真的屬實。無論如何，他感到非常不滿。因此，他讓米切爾和基辛格一起來看看這些事情。我認為他們三個人開了一次會議，比較了一下，「這些事情有什麼問題。為什麼我們不喜歡它們？」其中一個優先的投訴就是這種缺乏對事實和意見的區分。

--- 段落 342 (248 字元) ---
84 Not just that they don’t separate them, but the thing is  written in a way that you don’t know whether that’s a fact, or a judgment, and  that you needed clearly stated what things are facts, and what things are inferences, judgments, and so on.

[翻譯]
不僅是他們不將它們分開，而且這件事寫得讓人不知道那是事實還是判斷，而且您需要明確地陳述哪些事實，哪些是推論、判斷等。

--- 段落 343 (442 字元) ---
Now Kissinger, when he first talked to me, had other complaints, in the sense  that… He said to me, “Look, on the intelligence reports with respect to technology and so on, I’m not able to judge…but in the political stuff I feel I can judge and  they’re terrible.They’re not better than, and indeed they’re probably worse than  the kind of stuff you just read in the newspapers every day.They have no real  depth….There’s nothing behind them.

[翻譯]
現在 Kissinger，當他第一次與我交談時，有其他抱怨，意指...他對我說：“看，關於技術等方面的情報報告，我無法判斷...但在政治方面，我覺得我能夠判斷，它們糟透了。它們不比每天在報紙上讀到的那些消息好，實際上可能還更糟。它們毫無真正深度...背後毫無內涵。"

--- 段落 344 (288 字元) ---
The people writing them don’t seem to  have any real understanding of what’s going on.They report what’s going on but  then they go off and they have their speculations and so on and they’re just not  really worth anything.”  
- Q1: Was Kissinger really interested in intelligence reform?

[翻譯]
寫這些東西的人似乎並不真正了解正在發生的事情。他們報導了正在發生的事，但然後他們進行了推測等等，實際上並沒有什麼價值。
- 問題1：基辛格真的對情報改革感興趣嗎？

--- 段落 345 (461 字元) ---
- Marshall: Now, of course, part of the problem was Henry was… He would talk  with somebody like me or someone on the staff about how terrible, rotten it all  was, but then he would never really say that to the intelligence people.I think  it showed up in the whole way in which he conducted business while he was in  government, certainly in the State Department, where he gathered a set of people around him and then shut off the rest of the State Department.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：當然，亨利的問題之一是...他會和我或其他工作人員談論這一切有多麼糟糕，但他從來沒有真正對情報人員說過。我認為這在他在政府任職期間的整個業務運作中表現出來，特別是在國務院，他聚集了一群人周圍，然後把國務院其他部門的人擋在外面。

--- 段落 346 (457 字元) ---
I don’t know whether Nixon said he wanted someone to look into this, and that’s  why Henry called up and had me do these initial studies…  
- Q1: Did Fred Iklé recommended you to Kissinger for the work on intelligence?- Marshall: Well, I think so, I mean you might talk with Fred, I never really asked him.- Q1: When were you first asked to work for Kissinger?- Marshall: I must have got this call in September of ‘69 because I dropped by to see  Kissinger.

[翻譯]
我不知道尼克森是否說過他想要有人研究這個問題，這就是為什麼亨利打電話給我要我進行這些初步研究的原因...
- Q1：是弗雷德·伊克勒向您推薦了與基辛格合作對情報工作的嗎？- 馬歇爾：嗯，我想是的，您可以和弗雷德談談，我從來沒有真正問過他。
- Q1：您是何時被要求為基辛格工作的？- 馬歇爾：我一定是在1969年的9月接到這個電話，因為我當時去看了基辛格。

--- 段落 347 (448 字元) ---
Actually, the call came from Al Haig, asking me whether I’d come by  and see Kissinger.I was on my way to Europe for a lengthy vacation, probably  around the middle or the third week in September.So I dropped by Washington on my way and had a meeting with Kissinger.And then, I think I was away about a  month, and came back.Then had to disengage myself from the stuff I was doing  at RAND.I ended up going there in the very early part of December.

[翻譯]
事實上，打來的電話是來自阿爾海格，問我是否可以過去見基辛格。當時我正在去歐洲度長假的途中，可能是在九月中旬或第三周左右。所以我路過華盛頓，在途中與基辛格見面。我大概離開一個月，然後回來。之後我必須從在蘭德所做的工作中脫身。最後我在十二月初去了那裡。

--- 段落 348 (421 字元) ---
- Q1: What can you say about your study of intelligence flow to the White House?- Marshall: The first thing that I did was this study tracing the whole flow of intelligence into the White House.How it happened, how decisions were made about  what to send.First I found out, “Where does this stuff actually come from?” Then  I interviewed people from each of these places to look into how it was they went  about deciding.

[翻譯]
Q1：請問您對情報流向白宮的研究有何看法？- 馬歇爾：我做的第一件事是進行這項研究，追踪所有情報流入白宮的過程。發生了什麼事，關於要發送什麼決定是如何做出的。首先我找出了，“這些情報究竟來自哪裡？”然後我訪問了來自每個地方的人，調查他們是如何做出決定的。

--- 段落 349 (432 字元) ---
NSA had a very organized kind of interface and they had some people who would  come down essentially once a month and sit down… Not just with the guy who  ran the Situation Room, who was in fact a guy from NSA, but to sit around with  some other people and try to say, “Well, OK, what are the things that are of most  interest…”  
- Q1: But the NSA representatives would meet with people from the NSC staff?Who  was talking to whom?

[翻譯]
NSA擁有一個非常有組織的界面，他們有一些人基本上每個月都會來參加，坐下來…不僅與負責情報室的那個人見面，實際上他是NSA的一個人，還與其他一些人圍坐在一起，試圖說：“好吧，哪些事情最有趣…”
- Q1: 但NSA代表會與NSC工作人員會面嗎？誰在和誰交談？

--- 段落 350 (358 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, it really was with the people in… My impression was they met with  the two people who ran the Situation Room and some of the other analysts who  were in the Situation Room.And it was probably through them that they understood what people on the staff wanted, were requesting, had an interest in, etc.,  etc.Whereas the CIA did none of that.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，實際上是與…我的印象是他們與掌控情報室的兩個人和其他一些分析師見面。可能是通過他們了解職員想要什麼、要求什麼、感興趣的事情等等。而中央情報局卻沒有這樣做。

--- 段落 351 (342 字元) ---
No, somebody told me that that the CIA took its cues from The New York Times  in deciding what intelligence to send to the White House; I don’t know whether  he was being dismissive.But their [Eds: the CIA’s] whole idea was that they know  what’s interesting and important, I mean you just have to read the newspapers or  something like that.

[翻譯]
不，有人告訴我說中央情報局從紐約時報那裡汲取靈感，決定要送哪些情報給白宮；我不知道他是否在表示輕蔑。但他們（指中央情報局）整個理念是他們知道什麼是有趣且重要的，我的意思是你只需要讀報紙之類的東西就可以了。

--- 段落 352 (491 字元) ---
It was, “We have this high-quality product…”  Now, a lot of that was particularly targeted on the issue of what went into the  daily President’s report, but just more generally, they just felt that through the  attendance of Helms and others at various meetings and other things that they  just didn’t need any special apparatus or to spend much real effort at finding out.They just didn’t spend much effort of any systematic sort.- Q1: It was a long-standing problem?- Marshall: I think so.

[翻譯]
這樣說，「我們擁有這個高質量的產品...」。如今，很多人特別關注每日總統報告中的問題，但更廣泛地看，他們覺得透過參加不同會議和其他活動，像是海姆斯等人，他們並不需要任何特別的設備或花很多真正的努力去找出答案。他們就是沒有花太多系統性的努力。- 問題1：這是個長期存在的問題嗎？- 馬歇爾：我想是的。

--- 段落 353 (306 字元) ---
I talked with members of the Kennedy/Johnson NSC staffs and  they had similar complaints about intelligence.But again, one of the things I said  is how little they seemed to care about the customers, even though they protest  that, “We’re here to serve,” particularly these top level people would say this.

[翻譯]
我與甘迺迪/約翰遜國家安全會議的成員交談，他們對情報機構也有類似的抱怨。但是，我提到的一點是，他們似乎對客戶非常不在乎，盡管他們抗議說：“我們在這裡為客戶服務”，特別是這些高級人士經常這樣說。

--- 段落 354 (480 字元) ---
One  of the first things I did when I went to work for Kissinger permanently was to go  through a number of books that Kissinger recently had written and extracted  from them sections that I thought provided the most insight into how he looked  at the world, what he thought, the kind of information that would be useful to  him, and sent that around to them.But that’s the kind of thing, in my view, if they  were serious about their offers of help, they would do for themselves.

[翻譯]
當我正式加入基辛格團隊工作時，我做的第一件事之一是閱讀基辛格最近寫的一些書籍，並從中提取我認為能最深入了解他如何看待世界、他的想法以及對他有用的資訊的部分，然後把這些內容發送給團隊。但我認為，如果他們真的認真提供協助的話，他們應該自己去做這樣的事情。

--- 段落 355 (375 字元) ---
But they  didn’t do any of that.Just really crazy.So, to a large extent they thought that they had their way of doing things and  it was the best way and they didn’t—despite their talk of wanting to help, they  were very unresponsive to what customers actually wanted, even somebody like  Kissinger.- Q1: Did the CIA interface with groups at Harvard, Stanford, and elsewhere?

[翻譯]
但他們沒有做任何事情。真的很瘋狂。因此，在很大程度上，他們認為他們有自己的做事方式，這是最好的方式，但是儘管他們說想要幫助，他們對顧客實際想要的東西非常不關心，甚至像基辛格這樣的人。-問題1：CIA是否與哈佛、斯坦福等地的團體接觸過？

--- 段落 356 (490 字元) ---
- Marshall: The thing that struck me at the time was how at that point the CIA had  kind of shut itself off from much connection with any other organizations doing  stuff that could potentially have been interesting to it.And they kind of seemed  to have, for the while, just adopted the notion of, “We’re the real experts, we don’t  need to talk to other people.” Which was very different than the situation in the  ‘50s.- Q1: How did the CIA of the ‘50s differ from that of the late ‘60s?

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：當時讓我印象深刻的是，當時CIA已經與其他可能對其有興趣的組織切斷了很大程度的聯繫。他們似乎在那段時間內只是採納了“我們是真正的專家，不需要與其他人交流”的觀點。這與50年代的情況非常不同。- Q1：50年代的CIA與60年代末期的CIA有何不同？

--- 段落 357 (471 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, I guess my own experience of it was really being at RAND… It may  have been particular to RAND, but not exclusively.Because they had this special  group up at MIT.I forget the guy’s name now who was up there… But they had a  number of connections out.Now, that was a kind of contracting arrangement to  get certain kinds of studies… But it was a way of having an interface with people  in academia, working in the economics and political science worlds.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，我想我的經驗主要是在蘭德研究所…這可能是特定於蘭德，但並非專屬。因為他們在麻省理工學院有這個特殊的團體。我現在忘記了那個在那裡的人的名字…但他們有一些與外界的聯繫。這是一種合約安排，用來進行特定類型的研究…但這是一種與學術界中從事經濟學和政治科學的人建立界面的方式。

--- 段落 358 (365 字元) ---
In the case  of RAND, people came out, particularly Frank Walters and Wally Seidel, who were  analysts working on the Soviet missile programs, aircraft programs.And in the  middle ‘50s, ‘56 or so, they started to come out to try to understand what RAND  was doing in the systems analysis-type of analysis techniques, how they might be  used in what they were doing.

[翻譯]
在RAND的案例中，特別是Frank Walters和Wally Seidel這兩位分析師，他們在蘇聯導彈計劃和飛機計劃上工作。 在50年代中期，大約1956年左右，他們開始出來試圖了解RAND正使用系統分析類型的分析技術，以及這些技術如何應用在他們正在進行的工作中。

--- 段落 359 (450 字元) ---
Also in a certain sense the beginnings of their effort to cost the Soviet programs, to do a comprehensive effort, that a guy named  Jerry Godaire, who was out at the Agency.85… some of the ideas came from  people like Loftus and me at RAND.That you needed to do something like that to  check on the overall resource demands implied by various kinds of programs that  the Soviets were undertaking.Anyway, there was quite active interchange with  them.

[翻譯]
在某種意義上，他們開始試圖評估蘇聯的計劃成本，做了一個全面的努力，這是由一個名叫傑瑞·戈代爾(Jerry Godaire)居於機構。一些想法來自像洛夫特斯和我在蘭德公司的人。你需要做一些類似的事情，來檢查蘇聯正在進行的各種計劃所暗示的整體資源需求。總之，我們與他們之間進行了非常活躍的交流。

--- 段落 360 (349 字元) ---
And then somehow, by the late ‘60s, it had pretty much dried up, I think.And I  think it came about, in part, because of, maybe this sense that, “We’re the real professionals and we don’t really need to keep up these connections.” Secondly, the  people in the ‘50s— The whole place was made up of people who were brought  in just a few years before.

[翻譯]
然後，不知怎的，到了60年代後期，我想這種情況幾乎已經消失了。我認為這可能是因為“我們是真正的專業人士，不需要保持這些聯繫”的感覺出現了一部分。其次，在50年代，那裡的人們-整個地方都是由幾年前才過來的人建立的。

--- 段落 361 (290 字元) ---
But by the late ‘60s, you were beginning to have people  rise fairly high in the bureaucracy who had come in and their whole careers had  been within the Agency.And I remember, in fact, in the ‘60s, when I was brought on… Well, I was an Agency consultant from about ‘56, I guess, something.

[翻譯]
但到了60年代晚期，開始有一些人在官僚體系中升得相當高，他們進入機構後整個職業生涯都在機構內度過。我記得，事實上，在60年代，當我被引進時…嗯，我應該是從大約56年開始成為機構顧問。

--- 段落 362 (429 字元) ---
Anyway…I suppose it would  have been the early ‘60s… Under McCone an organization was formed called National Intelligence Programs Evaluation (NIPE), headed by John Bross, and it was  to look at the broadest management issues of the community as a whole.Bross  for some reason knew something about me—I don’t know exactly how that had  come about—but he invited me to come in to see him, and then he made me a  consultant of his.

[翻譯]
無論如何...我想應該是在60年代初...在麥康的領導下，成立了一個名為國家情報計畫評估（NIPE）的組織，由約翰·布羅斯領導，主要是為了全體社群的廣泛管理議題。布羅斯出於某種原因知道一些關於我的事情-我不確定這是如何發生的-但他邀請我去見他，然後讓我成為他的顧問。

--- 段落 363 (405 字元) ---
In fact, that was one of the most active relationships [indistinct] in the ‘60s.And he said to me once that it really worried him that this combination  of their having moved out to McLean and the fact that people in the Agency had  spent their whole professional lives in the Agency and didn’t know anybody, let  alone in the rest of the city, but in, you know, New York or wherever, really worried  him.

[翻譯]
事實上，在六十年代，這是其中一段最活躍的關係。他曾經告訴我，他真的很擔心他們搬到麥克林和那些在機構工作一生卻不認識任何人的人，連在城市其他地方，例如紐約或其他地方，都不認識，這讓他非常擔心。

--- 段落 364 (447 字元) ---
He used to shake his head about what that was going to lead to, because of  his own experience and that it was very valuable to have contacts in other worlds,  whether it was on Wall Street or wherever it is that you can get information from.And these people going up with these new careers didn’t have any of that.- Q1: Did the situation improve?- Marshall: “Consumer research” by the intelligence community has gotten a little  better over time.

[翻譯]
他過去常為那將導致什麼而搖頭，因為根據他自己的經驗，在其他世界建立聯繫非常寶貴，無論是在華爾街還是其他地方，都可以從中獲取信息。這些人開始進行新的事業時並沒有任何這方面的經驗。問1：情況有改善嗎？- 馬歇爾：隨著時間的推移，情報界對“消費者研究”有了一些進步。

--- 段落 365 (355 字元) ---
They now do some surveys of users; I don’t know that it really  influences what they do.It was striking how little interface or real knowledge they  had of what consumers wanted.One of the things I did was to conduct a survey of people on the NSC staff about  what they wanted.Strengths, weaknesses, what things weren’t they getting that  they might want.

[翻譯]
他們現在對用戶進行一些調查；我不知道這是否真正影響他們的做法。令人驚訝的是，他們對消費者想要什麼幾乎沒有界面或真正的了解。我做的事情之一是對NSC工作人員進行調查，了解他們想要什麼。優勢，劣勢，他們沒有得到的東西是什麼，他們可能想要的。

--- 段落 366 (440 字元) ---
Found they wanted, if they could get it, some of the products to  be focused on longer term trends, basic things that were happening, not the dayto-day events, more speculative about the future, but really thoughtful.Producing such things runs up against the ethos of people in the intelligence  community, that they shouldn’t be speculating, that they should be getting hard  information and then at most interpreting that for the readers.

[翻譯]
他們發現，如果可能的話，他們希望有一些產品專注於長期趨勢，基本的事情正在發生，不是每天的事件，更多是對未來的推測，但真正富有思考性。製作這些東西如同與情報界的人倫理觀念相抵觸，他們認為不應該進行推測，而應該獲取硬性信息，然後對讀者進行最多的解釋。

--- 段落 367 (364 字元) ---
But the actual  consumers wanted something rather different, at least in part.But the consumers  also wanted to know where there were controversies and differences of opinion  within the intelligence community.But again, at that point, the community was devoted to the notion that they  should resolve their differences internally and kind of speak with one voice.

[翻譯]
但實際消費者想要的東西有些不同，至少在某種程度上。消費者也想知道情報界內部的爭議和意見分歧。但當時，情報界致力於解決內部分歧，並且統一發聲。

--- 段落 368 (387 字元) ---
But  also, I guess the thing that drove some of this stuff about these new institutions,  like the NSCIC [Eds: National Security Council Intelligence Committee], was this  dissatisfaction of Kissinger and Nixon with the products, that they just didn’t think  were very good and lacking real intellectual quality.- Q1: What was the background of your study of the quality of intelligence?

[翻譯]
但我猜想，驅使一些有關這些新機構，如國家安全委員會情報委員會，的事情的原因是，基辛格和尼克松對產品的不滿，他們認為這些產品質量不高，缺乏真正的知識品質。問題1：您對情報品質的研究背景是什麼？

--- 段落 369 (453 字元) ---
- Marshall: When I was about to start work, I had another meeting with Kissinger in  which we reviewed again what he wanted done.And after discussion, one of the  things that I was asked to do as a second study was to make a judgment after  really looking at the assessments, estimates of the missile programs, because that  was the big thing that was happening… It had been left slightly open what particular area to pick to do this quality assessment.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：當我即將開始工作時，我又和基辛格開了一次會，我們再次檢討他希望完成的任務。經過討論後，我被要求進行第二項研究，要在真正查看對飛彈計劃進行的評估和估計後做出判斷，因為這是發生的重要事情... 就這個質量評估要選擇做哪個特定領域有些模糊不清。

--- 段落 370 (458 字元) ---
And it was then that essentially  the Soviet strategic missiles programs were picked.SS-9 was one of the biggest  of the issues.Questions about how many there were, what the characteristics of  the new systems were.And it wasn’t only just the technical things, but there were  issues of whether they had reloads, what was the motivation for moving to the  new systems…  
- Q1: I was just interested in why Kissinger was interested in the missiles assessment.

[翻譯]
當時蘇聯戰略導彈計劃開始被重視。SS-9導彈是其中一個重要議題。人們紛紛問起有多少個導彈、新系統的特點是什麼等問題。不僅僅是技術問題，還有關於是否有替裝、轉向新系統的動機是什麼等議題…

- 問題1：我只是對基辛格為何對導彈評估感興趣感到好奇。

--- 段落 371 (396 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, I think I proposed it, because I knew that it was an area of interest to  him.- Q1: And you had a competence in the area.- Marshall: And he agreed with that.- Q1: What were your findings?- Marshall: I thought there were just a lot of limitations, I guess in the NIEs on Soviet  strategic forces.I’m a little vague at this point on my findings.It wasn’t a very  favorable report.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：嗯，我想我提出這個建議，因為我知道這是他感興趣的領域。- Q1：而且你在這個領域有能力。- 馬歇爾：他同意了這一點。- Q1：你的研究發現是什麼？- 馬歇爾：我覺得NIE對蘇聯戰略力量存在很多限制，這方面的研究結果並不太理想。我對自己的研究結果有點模糊。

--- 段落 372 (454 字元) ---
In the sense that… There were things that they did report on  that represented the very skillful effort that was being made through various collection devices to analyze the programs, I mean in the sense of, you know, a new  silo was going in here or there, or, you know, “We see this at the test facilities at  Tyuratam,” and so on.Or various other technical analyses about the performance  of these missiles.But beyond that, there just wasn’t anything.

[翻譯]
就在這方面...他們報導了一些代表著透過各種收集裝置進行分析所做出的非常精湛的努力，我的意思是，你知道，在這裡或那裡出現了新的主塔，或者說，“我們在圖拉塔姆測試設施看到了這一切”，等等。還有關於這些導彈性能的各種技術分析。但除此之外，就沒有其他東西了。

--- 段落 373 (296 字元) ---
And I remember later, when I was working for Kissinger, not when I was doing  this study, there was a book called The Soviet Space Bluff [The Russian Space Bluff],  written by a defector [Leonid Vladimirov], which was filled with fascinating stuff,  giving you the names of the various designers.

[翻譯]
我記得以後在為基辛格工作時，而不是在進行這項研究時，有一本書名為《蘇聯太空謊言》[俄羅斯太空謊言]，由一名叛逃者[李奧尼德·弗拉迪米羅夫]撰寫，充滿迷人的內容，提供各種設計師的名字。

--- 段落 374 (472 字元) ---
I mean the intelligence community was very late in providing any information about—I brought this book to the  attention of people in the Agency, but they never did anything about it, to go  interview this guy, or anything.I mean, he was living in England.So, any sense of the personnel rivalries, the process by which these things were  designed, or about the organizations and so on…they didn’t provide anything.Or they…We didn’t have any broad sweeping recommendations.

[翻譯]
我指的是情報機構非常晚才提供有關這本書的任何信息 - 我向機構的人提到這本書，但他們從未採取任何行動，去採訪這個人，或者其他任何事情。我是說，他當時住在英格蘭。所以，關於人員之間的競爭，這些事情的設計過程，或者有關機構等等的情況...他們沒有提供任何信息。或者說...我們沒有任何廣泛的建議。

--- 段落 375 (476 字元) ---
We had some  recommendations which came out of this look at missile things, which led to this  proposal to do this prototype SS-9 study as an exemplar of the kind of the level of  analysis you would like to see.- Q1: Did your findings have an impact?- Marshall: Mmmm, ah, maybe a slight bit of improvement in subsequent NIEs as a  result of this exercise.I don’t know.The real improvement came with Larry Gershwin going out there.I mean it took that to make a real difference.

[翻譯]
在這次對導彈事物的研究中，我們得出了一些建議，這促成了這個對SS-9原型的研究提案，作為您希望看到的分析水準的示範。 Q1：您的研究結果是否產生影響？- 馬歇爾：嗯，或許這次練習的結果在隨後的NIEs中稍微有所改善。我不知道。真正的改善是由拉里格什溫帶出去的。我意思是這才會有真正的不同。

--- 段落 376 (418 字元) ---
He didn’t go out  there until Harry Rowen went out there.So it was the very early ‘80s.- Q1: What other areas of intelligence analysis needed improvement, in your opinion?- Marshall: One of the things I tried to get them to look at, like when they did this  special SS-9 study, was…try to get at things like the manpower costs associated  with different systems—Was that a motive for switching to newer systems or not?

[翻譯]
直到哈里·羅文走出去才去那裡。所以那是在80年代初期。問題1：在您看來，情報分析的哪些其他領域需要改進？- 馬歇爾：我試圖讓他們看到的一個事情是，就像當他們進行這個特別的SS-9研究時，嘗試去了解與不同系統相關的人力成本 - 這是否是改換新系統的動機？

--- 段落 377 (496 字元) ---
They seemed to be content to just report, “Well, two more silos have started,” with  no interpretation of, “Why is that happening?What does that suggest?” Couldn’t  provide any insight about any of the internal processes that led to any of these  things.Because I had requested it, they at least made an attempt to answer some of  these other kinds of questions.But again, it seemed to me that it was very important to understand the economics of this, I mean, what did these things really  cost?

[翻譯]
他們似乎只滿足於報告說：“好吧，又有兩個糧倉開始運作了”，沒有對“為什麼會發生這種情況？這意味著什麼？”進行任何解釋。他們無法提供任何關於導致這些事情發生的任何內部過程的見解。因為我已經請求過，他們至少試圖回答一些其他類型的問題。但再一次，對我來說很重要的是要了解這個經濟學，我的意思是，這些事情到底成本是多少？

--- 段落 378 (407 字元) ---
So, anyway, they made a stab at these things.Also, more about the relation of the SS-9 to the SS-7 and things like that, so you get some sense of the evolution of their systems and so on.- Q1: How long did the SS-9 study take?- Marshall: It was more like a year study, from spring 1970 to fall 1971.- Q1: Among the other special products for Kissinger, the main thing was the analysis  of key personalities?

[翻譯]
所以，無論如何，他們試圖對這些事情有所了解。而且，關於SS-9與SS-7之間的關係等等，這樣你就能感受到他們系統的演進等等。- Q1：SS-9的研究花了多久時間？- 馬歇爾：這更像是一年的研究，從1970年春天到1971年秋天。- Q1：對於基辛格的其他特別產品，主要是分析關鍵人物嗎？

--- 段落 379 (377 字元) ---
- Marshall: Biographic intelligence guidelines, if I remember correctly, it was kind of  a two-page form to be filled in that had headings, specifying the kind of information we wanted about the person.But I don’t think it ever had any impact at all.In the first place, Henry had this great interest in these people that he might have  to deal with in one fashion or the other.

[翻譯]
Marshall：如果我沒記錯的話，生平情報指引是一種兩頁表格，需要填寫有關人物信息的項目。但我認為它根本沒有任何影響力。首先，亨利對這些人感興趣，他或許需要以某種方式與他們打交道。

--- 段落 380 (448 字元) ---
One of the first things that came up was  this interest that he had in these psychological profiles that had been prepared  by Jerry Post and other people out at the CIA, which he wanted more of.He even  had the idea of some psychiatrist up in the Boston area, that was connected with  a very famous…this was a professional psychiatric clinic for the treatment of mental  diseases…I know about it from the work that I’d done with Herbert Goldhamer.

[翻譯]
其中一件首先浮現的事情是他對那些由Jerry Post和其他CIA的人準備的心理學檔案的興趣，他希望有更多這樣的資料。他甚至想到波士頓地區的某位精神科醫師，這位醫師和一家非常有名的…這是一家專門治療精神疾病的專業精神科診所有關…我對此有所了解是因為我和Herbert Goldhamer合作的工作。

--- 段落 381 (324 字元) ---
It  existed way back in the 1830s, 1840s and it was a private place where people with  mental problems could go, as contrasted with the state system of asylums.86 Any -  way, so Kissinger even wanted to get more work and thought it would be interesting  for this guy to somehow get involved in this.So he wanted more effort.

[翻譯]
這個地方起源於1830年代和1840年代，是一個供患有精神問題的人前往的私人場所，與國家精神病院制度形成對比。無論如何，Kissinger甚至想要做更多工作，認為讓這個人某種方式參與其中會很有趣。因此，他想要更多努力。

--- 段落 382 (324 字元) ---
People in  the Agency were extremely reluctant, just didn’t consider it one of their top-ofthe-line products, a little disreputable…it’s speculative, it’s a little oddball, etc.The thing that was striking to me was, OK, here’s something that Henry liked,  thought was useful, wanted more of, but essentially couldn’t get it.

[翻譯]
機構內的人們非常不情願，他們並不認為這是他們頂尖產品之一，有點名聲不佳...這是一個投機性的東西，有點古怪，等等。對我來說，令人驚訝的是，這是亨利喜歡的事物，認為很有用，想要更多，但基本上無法得到。

--- 段落 383 (274 字元) ---
And then when this coup took place, he was again… “Well, who are these  people…” And you have the background in the files, which is about, as I put it in  a kind of cynical way, sarcastic way… I mean it’s fine if you’re going to entertain  them, they like scotch or bourbon.

[翻譯]
當這次政變發生時，他再次...「那這些人是誰...」並且你在檔案中擁有背景，就像我用一種玩世不恭、諷刺的方式表達的那樣... 我的意思是，如果你要款待他們，他們喜歡威士忌或波本酒。

--- 段落 384 (442 字元) ---
It’s stuff that’s presumably acquired or written  down based on social contacts with these people, some sense of them, whether  they’re womanizers or not, but there’s nothing about what are they really like psychologically, as personalities, except sort of crude descriptors, you know, “A strong  person.” Nothing about ideological beliefs.So it’s very limited, it doesn’t show  any insight into the person at all.Just puts him in a category.

[翻譯]
這些資料可能是根據與這些人的社交聯繫所獲得或撰寫下來的，對他們有一定的了解，無論他們是否風流成性，但並沒有深入探討他們在心理上真正是什麼樣的人，作為個性，除了一些粗糙的描述，你知道，“一個堅強的人”。沒有提及意識形態信仰。因此這非常有限，完全沒有展示對這個人的洞察力，只是把他歸類於某個範疇。

--- 段落 385 (488 字元) ---
You know, “Catholic,” “military officer,” “likes bourbon” or “likes rock-and-roll music.” No information  about his thinking, or how he might behave in certain circumstances.- Q1: The coup was in Panama?- Marshall: Maybe a “coup” is too dramatic a word.Takeover of the government by a  military officer, I think.So Kissinger gets this stuff and they barely know much about these people.Maybe only for one or two of them there’s even any data at all and what it is this  piffling material.

[翻譯]
你知道，“天主教徒”，“軍官”，“喜歡波本威士忌”或“喜歡搖滾音樂”。沒有關於他的思想或在某些情況下可能如何行為的信息。- Q1：這次政變發生在巴拿馬嗎？- 馬歇爾：也許“政變”這個詞太戲劇化了。我想是由軍官接管政府。所以基辛格得到這些東西，他們對這些人幾乎一無所知。也許只有一兩個人有任何數據，而這些數據幾乎微不足道。

--- 段落 386 (443 字元) ---
So I get asked, “What could be done about this?” So I looked into  this, tried to understand a little more about how the thing worked, but only for a  few days.Then said, “Well, one thing you could do at least is write down what it is you want about these people, what would be useful to you.” And we did that and  sent it over.- Q1: Would greater use of the Bayesian method for analysis and communication  have improved intelligence analysis?

[翻譯]
所以有人問我，“這件事可以怎麼辦？”所以我調查了一下，試著更了解這件事是如何運作的，但只有幾天。然後我說，“好吧，至少你可以做的一件事是寫下你對這些人的需求，對你有用的是什麼。”我們做到了，然後把它送了過去。- Q1: 如果更廣泛地使用Bayesian方法進行分析和溝通，是否會提高智慧分析能力？

--- 段落 387 (395 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well again, that came up right at the beginning, because one of the  things that also came out of this early technique [?] was the way that uncertainties were handled in this kind of backhanded way of, in paragraph 28 they say  one thing and then they halfway take it back in paragraph 57.Uncertainty should  be more squarely faced, they should look for ways of presenting the thing.

[翻譯]
Marshall: 嗯，這又一次是在一開始就出現的，因為早期技術中發現的其中一個問題是，不確定性是如何以一種迂迴的方式處理的，就像第28段提到了一件事情，然後在第57段卻又半途而廢。應該更直接面對不確定性，他們應該尋找展示事物的方法。

--- 段落 388 (481 字元) ---
And  Kissinger was in favor of this even in saying, “Well, there are six alternatives and  here are our best guesses about the probabilities of those.” Well, they didn’t like  that at all.- Q1: Did they make some effort?- Marshall: Well, there were a couple of experiments to do that.But I think they were  kind of halfhearted.They were being forced to do something they didn’t like.At  the level of the Board of National Estimates, it was just seen as too crude and not  literary.

[翻譯]
基辛格甚至認同這一點，說：“嗯，有六種選擇，這是我們對這些可能性的最佳猜測。”嗯，他們一點也不喜歡這樣的做法。- 問：他們有做出努力嗎？- 馬歇爾：嗯，有一些實驗試圖這樣做。但我認為他們不太積極。他們被迫做他們不喜歡的事情。在國家評估委員會層面上，這被認為太過粗糙而且不夠文學化。

--- 段落 389 (462 字元) ---
That’s not the way you would try to convey any of these things.The Bayesian method is partly how you do analysis and partly how do you present the stuff.- Q1: Was the use of Bayesian methods driven by the studies by Kelly and Peterson?- Marshall: So those guys were…I guess Kelly, when I first met him, was at DARPA,  then he went off into this— There were a couple of small firms that were pushing  this sort of analysis and how you would do that kind of thing.

[翻譯]
這不是你想要傳達這些事情的方式。贝叶斯方法在分析時部分應用，部分呈現資訊。問題1：凱利和彼得森的研究促使使用贝叶斯方法嗎？- 馬歇爾：那些人......我想，凱利，當我第一次遇見他時，他正在DARPA工作，然後他轉而專注於這個......有幾家小公司正在推這種分析方法和實踐的方式。

--- 段落 390 (102 字元) ---
There was another  guy that I knew from RAND that was at Michigan…Ward Edwards…a set of these  people.

[翻譯]
我認識一位在密歇根大學的蘭德研究所的另一位人，名叫沃德·愛德華茲...這些人中的一員。

--- 段落 391 (438 字元) ---
There was both the presentational kind of thing…the Bayesian kind of  thing… But then there was also a set of people out there that were working on  situations where you get information over time…and supposing you have a  set of estimates, the likelihood of various alternatives, and you get a new piece  of information, how do you modify each of these… In fact one thing I did was  I sponsored a conference out in Coronado in California.

[翻譯]
有兩種方式呈現…貝葉斯方式…但也有一群人在研究隨著時間推移而獲得資訊的情況…假設你有一組估計值、各種不同的可能性，當你得到新的資訊時，該如何修改這些…事實上，我曾贊助在加利福尼亞州科羅納多舉行的一場會議。

--- 段落 392 (455 字元) ---
There people who had  been working in this field were all brought together…  
- Q1: Now, was this while you were at the NSC or afterward?- Marshall: Probably was after, because I think I got DARPA to put up the money,  yeah, probably soon after I got to the Pentagon.But Pat Crecine I remember was  there, this guy from Michigan.- Q1: Now what did Kissinger think of some of these experiments or the results of  these experiments?- Marshall: I forget now.

[翻譯]
那些在這個領域工作過的人都聚在一起了...
- Q1：這是在你在NSC期間還是之後嗎？- 馬歇爾：可能是之後，因為我想我讓DARPA出錢了，是的，可能是我到五角大樓後不久吧。但我記得帕特·克雷辛在那裡，這個來自密歇根的家伙。- Q1：孟席格是如何看待這些實驗或者實驗結果的？- 馬歇爾：我現在忘記了。

--- 段落 393 (489 字元) ---
I know that we got some and shipped them into him.But I  don’t think we got much of a reaction.I think we tried it out on some of the other  people and they sort of liked it, but it wasn’t as though they were entranced by it.- Q1: Were there other ways in which you tried to improve intelligence analysis?- Marshall: I made this big effort on organizational behavior, but I described some of  that in the earlier interview or session.- Q1: While you were at the NSC?- Marshall: Yes, right.

[翻譯]
我知道我們有一些，然後把它們運送給他。但我覺得他的反應不是很強烈。我們也嘗試在其他一些人身上試驗，他們似乎有點喜歡，但並非對此著迷。- Q1: 您是否有其他方式試圖改善情報分析？- 馬歇爾：我在組織行為方面做出了很大的努力，但我在之前的訪談或會議中已經描述過一些了。- Q1: 在您在NSC時嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，就是那個時候。

--- 段落 394 (435 字元) ---
- Q1: Covering which topic?- Marshall: Well, the thing took two forms.One, there were a few people at the Agency  who were quite interested in it, particularly some of the people over in the clandestine services side, that I had gotten to know while I was at RAND, because they  had come to me to try to get some information about a country that I had a lot  of contact with, and so I had talked to them somewhat in the course of that.

[翻譯]
問題1：涉及哪個主題？- 馬歇爾：嗯，這件事有兩個方面。首先，機構內有一些人對這個很感興趣，尤其是在秘密服務方面的一些人，我在蘭德研究所時與他們熟悉起來，因為他們找我取得一個我與一個國家有很多接觸的信息，所以在這過程中我有些對話。

--- 段落 395 (483 字元) ---
So,  after I was at the NSC, I said, “OK, look, here’s a way of doing analysis that might  be useful.I will try to tutor, in a way, although I don’t know what the right word  for it would be, some set of analysts, or some people, to try to make sure they  understand what it is they ought to try look at when they look at these organizations.What information do you really want to have?” And so on.So, three or four  of them came down several times and spent time talking about this.

[翻譯]
所以，在我去了NSC之後，我說：“好吧，這裡有一個可能會有用的分析方法。我會試著指導一些分析師，或者一些人，讓他們明白應該在查看這些組織時要看什麼。他們真正想要哪些信息？等等。所以，其中三到四位人幾次下來，花時間討論這個。

--- 段落 396 (332 字元) ---
And then…  That was one thing.There were these people who were very interested in it, who  kind of picked it up, did whatever they did with it, I don’t know, they kind of disappeared back into the clandestine services.Never had much effect on the people  in the Directorate of Intelligence.There may be some papers around from that.

[翻譯]
然後... 這是一件事。有一些人對這個非常感興趣，他們將它拿走，做了他們該做的事情，我不知道，他們隨後消失在秘密服務中。這並沒對情報局的人造成太大影響。也許這段時間會有一些文件。

--- 段落 397 (453 字元) ---
- Q1: There was an informal group of CIA producers you convened in late 1972 to  determine data needed to support intelligence analyses based on theories of organizational and human behavior.One member of the group looked at a case of  using those methodologies to understand the French position in GATT [General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] discussions in late 1973.Was that the same group?- Marshall: Well, it was kind of the second phase of that.

[翻譯]
問1：1972年底，您召集了一個非正式的CIA製作人小組，決定支持基於組織和人類行為理論的情報分析所需的數據。該小組的一名成員研究了一個案例，使用這些方法來了解1973年底關於GATT（關稅和貿易一般協定）談判的法國立場。這是同一個小組嗎？- 馬歇爾：嗯，這算是那個工作的第二階段。

--- 段落 398 (421 字元) ---
Because after we’d done  this other thing, just talking… What would you really want to know?I decided it  would be good to have a case that would be done, where they could show what  it was they could do.And it would be a kind of test of could they carry out something like this.Mainly the earlier discussions have been about, “Well, what do you  want to know?What are the kind of things you want to find out?” And so on.

[翻譯]
因為在我們做完這件事之後，只是在聊天...你真正想知道的是什麼？我決定好好安排一個案例，讓他們展示他們能做到的事情。這將是一種考驗，看看他們是否能完成這樣的事情。主要的早期討論都是關於，“嗯，你想知道什麼？你想找出什麼樣的事情？”等等。

--- 段落 399 (459 字元) ---
You’d  want to find out about the processes, who’s involved, things about the internal  procedures.But then it came to a point where we thought about, “Well, let’s do a  kind of test about what they can do.”  And the idea was—Or my idea was, “Well, look, a country I know about is France,  so let’s pick France.” It’s also, in principle, a country that we should be able to find  out a lot about.It’s not like Russia or China… So I went to see Ken [Kenneth W.

[翻譯]
你會想要了解這些過程，誰參與其中，內部程序的事情。但後來我們想到了一個問題，「好吧，讓我們來做一個測試看看他們能做什麼。」我的想法是 - 「好吧，我知道的國家是法國，所以就選擇法國吧。」原則上，這也是我們應該能夠找到很多信息的國家。這不像是俄羅斯或中國... 所以我去找了肯（肯尼斯·W.）。

]  Dam to discuss with him… He was a kind of special assistant to George Shultz,  who was then the Secretary of the Treasury, I think.But Dam had an office in the  White House…I don’t remember whether Shultz did.…I knew Dam quite well, so  I went to him and said, “What is a topic?What is something we could get them to  focus on?” And he said, “Well, look, something that would be interesting is French  agricultural policy.

[翻譯]
與他討論……他在喬治·舒爾茲（George Shultz）當時是財政部長的一種特別助手，我想。但是達姆（Dam）在白宮有一個辦公室……我不記得舒爾茲是否有。我很熟悉達姆，所以我去找他，問他：“有什麼話題？有什麼事情可以讓他們集中注意力？”他說：“嗯，看，一個有趣的話題是法國農業政策。”

--- 段落 401 (335 字元) ---
” And I know a lot about that… Because the idea was to pick  something that we [?] could judge how good this thing was.So we picked that.I then proposed that—and I forget who it was that exactly I proposed it to—It  might have been Ed Proctor, who was still the head of the intelligence directorate.And he picked a guy who was retired.

[翻譯]
我對這方面很了解...因為想法是要挑選一些我們可以評判這個事物有多好的東西。所以我們挑選了那個。然後我提議，我忘記確切是向誰提議了，可能是還在情報司令部任職的艾德·普羅克特。他挑選了一個已經退休的人。

--- 段落 402 (414 字元) ---
…I can’t remember the guy’s name now, but  he’s somebody who I’d known for a long time, who had an economics background  and had been in the Agency from way back in the ‘50s, had recently retired at this  point.Who had been a close friend to Joe Loftus.So had been up to RAND several  times.So I really knew him pretty well.So Proctor proposed that they get this guy  back out of retirement, and give him this job.

[翻譯]
…我現在記不得那個人的名字，但他是我認識很久的一個人，具有經濟學背景，從上世紀50年代就在機構工作，最近才退休。他曾是喬·洛夫塔斯的密友，所以曾多次到過蘭德公司。所以我真的很熟悉他。普羅克特建議重新請這個退休的人出來，給他這份工作。

--- 段落 403 (392 字元) ---
And the idea was for the person to  draw on—not to have to do collection so much—what already was in the Agency.What did they really know?Pull together everything they knew that would fit this  particular topic of their agricultural policy and their negotiations stances.And he  did this paper, which I thought was not really very good, and neither did Ken Dam,  because we both looked at it.

[翻譯]
這個想法是讓這個人去利用機構內已經存在的資料，而不是繼續進行大量的資料收集。他們究竟知道什麼？將所有他們知道與農業政策和談判立場相關的內容整合在一起。他完成了這份報告，我覺得這份報告不是很好，肯．達姆也是這麼認為，因為我們兩個都看過它。

--- 段落 404 (462 字元) ---
Because it really didn’t take over this organizational  behavior thing, didn’t get down to the level that you need.But, anyway, it wasn’t  pursued anymore.I took it to be, “Look, these guys may not be up to doing this.”  
- Q1: How were intelligence products delivered to users?- Marshall: At the time, there was almost an exclusive reliance on the publications.I  think there always was a certain trickle of people who came down and met faceto-face with people.

[翻譯]
因為它真的沒有完全掌握這個組織行為的事情，沒有達到你需要的水平。但無論如何，它不再被追求。我認為這是說：“看來這些人可能無法做到這一點。”
- Q1：情報產品是如何交付給使用者的？- 馬歇爾：當時，幾乎完全依靠出版物。我認為總是有一些人下來與人面對面會面。

--- 段落 405 (427 字元) ---
I don’t mean briefings, but coming to the office, talking with  them and so on.I think Frank Walters at the time felt there was too little of this,  and it’s not just that the intelligence person making some sort of presentation can  communicate more about what’s behind the thing, or can answer questions, but  also can come away with a better sense of what the people he’s talking to really  are interested in and care about.

[翻譯]
我不是指簡報，而是指走到辦公室，和他們交談等等。我認為當時的弗蘭克·沃爾特斯覺得這方面太少了，這不僅是情報人員進行某種形式的演示，可以更多地溝通的觀點，或者回答問題，而且還能更好地了解他正在交談的人們真正感興趣和關心的事情。

--- 段落 406 (348 字元) ---
Another thing I tried to have done—it kind of didn’t get anywhere—I thought  that there were some kind of topics that actually short videos would be better.For example, instead of trying to describe, through writing or even verbally,  how a multiple-warhead system worked, that a short video that showed how it  worked would communicate a lot more.

[翻譯]
我嘗試做的另一件事情──在某種程度上沒有進展──我覺得某些主題實際上更適合使用短片。例如，不是透過文字描述或甚至口頭解釋多頭彈道系統運作的方式，而是透過展示它是如何運作的短片，能傳達更多信息。

--- 段落 407 (291 字元) ---
Or, I felt—and again, neither of these  things was done very well—thought that… Well, one of the things that seemed  to be happening at the time was that… Because of the split with the Russians, the  Chinese were moving their forces, and repositioning them more to the north and  so on, etc.

[翻譯]
或者，我覺得 - 而且，這兩件事都沒有做得很好 - 認為... 嗯，當時似乎正在發生的一件事是...由於與俄羅斯的分裂，中國人正在調動他們的軍隊並將它們重新定位到更北部等地方。

--- 段落 408 (484 字元) ---
And that, for example, if one, again, had a kind of even like a cartoon  version…or a map, and time-phasing showing, OK, here’s where all of these  forces were in the early ‘50s, here is… These units have moved from here, they’re  now over here… Or people have been taken from here and moved to there…  Fortification programs begun and various other things.That you would be able  to see if that kind of thing was just… The time-sequencing—You would see the  adjustment of the forces.

[翻譯]

You would see also the big expansion of the Russian  forces along the—That would tell you more… First, the analyst would probably  see things he might not otherwise see.But they would be a wonderful way of  presenting things to people at the top level.I did have a primitive version of the MIRV thing done, that was never quite good  enough to show Henry, and the other one I kept asking people to do and never  succeeded in having it done.

[翻譯]
你也會看到俄羅斯軍隊的大規模擴張-這可以告訴你更多...首先，分析師可能會看到他可能否則看不到的東西。但這將是向高層人士呈現事物的一個很棒的方式。我曾經做過一個原始版本的MIRV計畫，但從來沒有好到足以展示給亨利看，我也一直讓人們做另一個版本，但從來沒有成功。

But I think there are just terrific possibilities in the  presentation of stuff other than having people just read these things or look at  static maps and so on.Everything we know about man’s evolutionary history is just tremendously focused on the eyes.

[翻譯]
不過我認為在呈現東西方面，除了讓人們閱讀這些資料或觀看靜態地圖之外，還有很棒的可能性。我們對於人類進化歷史的了解都非常專注在眼睛上。

Lionel Tiger says one of the reasons television is so compelling to people, as against reading, and is in some sense ruining  American education, as it is everyplace else, I guess, by competing for time with  people, is because people so prefer to get information… And the problem on  television is the information they get is so both inadequate and misguided that…  
- Q1: Any other presentation techniques?- Marshall: No, those were the main ones I think about.

[翻譯]
萊昂納爾·泰格認為，電視之所以對人們如此吸引，與閱讀相比，並且在某種程度上正在破壞美國的教育，也許在其他地方也是如此，是因為人們更喜歡獲取信息...電視上的問題是人們獲得的信息既不足夠也是偏誤的...

- Q1: 還有其他的呈現技巧嗎？- 馬歇爾：沒有了，這些是我所想到的主要的。

Frank Walters was a CIA analyst, one of the good guys from the ‘50s that I knew  very well.I can’t remember exactly what his ideas were, but they’re probably like  this {…} briefings, face-to- face contact.- Q1: Could you describe the impact of the Schlesinger report on reform of the intelligence community and the role you played?- Marshall: I think it was in December of ‘70 that Nixon kind of instructed Shultz and  Kissinger to undertake this review.

[翻譯]
Frank Walters是一名中情局分析師，是我從50年代就非常熟悉的好人之一。我記不清楚他的想法是什麼了，但可能是像這樣{...}簡報，面對面的接觸。- 問題1：您能描述施萊辛格報告對情報界改革的影響以及您所扮演的角色嗎？- 馬歇爾：我認為是在70年12月，尼克松讓舒爾茨和基辛格進行這個審查。

--- 段落 413 (378 字元) ---
And then I think initially there was a March  reporting date, and then some decisions were supposed to be made in April-May  or something.Then it got postponed till later.And so you had the March 1971  Schlesinger report, which was kind of an interim report.Then there was further  work and a final report which made…87 And as I look at this thing it looks kind of  descriptive.

[翻譯]
然後我想最初是在3月有一個報告的日期，然後一些決定應該在4月或5月做出。然後它被延期到以後。所以你有了1971年3月的舒勒辛格報告，這在某種程度上是一個臨時報告。然後有進一步的工作和最終報告...87而當我看著這件事時，它看起來有點描述性。

--- 段落 414 (454 字元) ---
And the thing that happened between this and the reports that came  out later… The later ones are focused more on recommendations about what to  do and kind of the rationale for the changes and so on.And while I was the NSC  representative on the thing in an actual way, I guess nominally Wayne Smith was,  but then he asked me to do it because I’d done these earlier intelligence studies  for Henry.And the bulk of the effort was done by the OMB people.

[翻譯]
在這之間發生的事情和後來出現的報告之間... 後來的報告更專注於建議應該怎麼做，以及改變的理據等等。雖然我在這件事上實際上是國家安全委員會的代表，我想名義上是韋恩·史密斯，但後來他要求我來做，因為我曾為亨利做過這些早期情報研究。而這項工作的大部分工作是由管理與預算辦公室的人完成的。

--- 段落 415 (403 字元) ---
What happened  at the end was, however, that Schlesinger had gone over to the AEC [Atomic  Energy Commission]—I forget the dates of that—I guess probably in September,  I wrote the final kind of summary that went up to Nixon.You know, Here’s what  is recommended, and also attached were the things he would sign, like a general  memo… A memo to Helms as to his new duties and what he was directed to do.

[翻譯]
然而，最後發生的是，施萊辛格已轉投至原子能委員會（AEC）——我忘記了那段的日期——我猜可能是在九月，我寫了最終的摘要，提交尼克松。你知道的，這裡建議了什麼，還附有他會簽署的事項，如一份一般的備忘錄... 一份給 Helms 的備忘錄，解釋他的新職責和被指示要做的事情。

--- 段落 416 (392 字元) ---
And I drafted all of that, because there wasn’t a comparable person over at OMB  because Schlesinger had left.…And there may have been the start of some kind  of a draft…I think there was a partial thing that…May well have been that Bill  Kaufmann had—Because he was acting as a consultant to Schlesinger at the time.But all of that stopped when Schlesinger left and I took over to finish it.

[翻譯]
我起草了所有的內容，因為OMB那邊沒有一個可以媲美的人，因為施萊辛格離開了……也許開始有一些草稿的痕跡……我想那時可能有一部分……也許是比爾·考夫曼有參與，因為他當時是施萊辛格的顧問。但當施萊辛格離職，我接手完成它時，所有這些都停止了。

Then Haig  and Smith undertook to send it around to the OMB people, to whoever else they  thought they needed to go to…Bronson Tweedy…I’m not sure all the people.And then a few changes and it was finalized… In fact, I prepared the final versions  and it was sent up through Smith and Kissinger, Haig, to Nixon to sign off on.- Q1: What happened after the recommendations went to Nixon?

[翻譯]
然後海格和史密斯承諾將其發送給OMB的相關人員，以及其他任何他們認為需要的人…布朗森·特溫迪…我不確定還有哪些人。然後進行了一些更改，最終定稿…實際上，我準備了最終版本，然後通過史密斯和基辛格、海格，交由尼克松簽署。- Q1：建議提交給尼克松後會發生什麼？

- Marshall: After the reorganization was put in place, improving community management, we were involved in monitoring the implementation of the reorganization,  and secondly, reviewing in selected areas the quality of the products.I spent a lot of time talking with people up near Helms, who were involved in  making the changes, particularly a man named Bronson Tweedy and just following what they did.They had to set up this new IC staff, there were personnel issues.

[翻譯]
Marshall: 在重新組織完成後，我們著手改善社區管理，參與監督重新組織的實施，並在特定領域審查產品的質量。我花了很多時間與負責進行改變的Helms附近的人交談，尤其是一個名叫Bronson Tweedy的人，並跟著他們的做法。他們必須建立這個新的IC團隊，涉及人事問題。

We’d monitor that and periodically make reports to Kissinger about it.We were  often consulted by those people.That was the main thing.We tried to do some things in the area of the training and management of analysis.One of the things we found was there was really no investment in the training  of analysts, or what there was was not very good.On the management side, we looked at the issue of career lines.And only in  a few areas did people stay in their particular area.

[翻譯]
我們會監控這個情況，並定期向基辛格報告。這些人常常會諮詢我們。這是主要的事情。我們試著在培訓和分析管理領域做些工作。我們發現一個問題是實際上並沒有對分析師的培訓進行投資，或者投資的效果並不明顯。在管理方面，我們關注職業生涯發展問題。只有少數幾個領域的人員會一直留在自己的專業領域裡。

--- 段落 420 (457 字元) ---
That happened in things  connected with the Soviet Union, but in other regional offices, people had very  little background.But again, even in the Soviet Union they had a group of people  dealing with the Soviet navy, but they turned over so rapidly that nobody there  ever got to have real expertise in the Soviet navy.So there’s this kind of incompatibility of the personnel system with getting really skilled people, knowledgeable  people doing analysis.

[翻譯]
這種情況在與蘇聯有關的事務中發生，但在其他地區辦事處裡，人們的背景非常有限。即使在蘇聯，他們也有一群負責處理蘇聯海軍事務的人，但因為人員流動過快，沒有人有機會真正掌握對蘇聯海軍的專業知識。因此，人員制度和培養真正有技術、有知識的分析人員之間存在著某種不相容性。

--- 段落 421 (343 字元) ---
We recommended that they look at that and see what they  wanted to do about that.We didn’t have any particular recommendations, we just  pointed out that there were really problems in terms of getting people to have  the intellectual capital to do a good job.I mean, what it comes back to in my mind— It shows also the virtue of lateral entry.

[翻譯]
我們建議他們看看這個問題，並想想他們想采取什麼行動。我們沒有特別的建議，只是指出在讓人們具有足夠的智力資本來做好工作方面確實存在問題。我是說，對我來說，最終歸結為橫向入職的優勢。

--- 段落 422 (488 字元) ---
I mean, again, one of the big problems with the career system out there is it’s  kind of based on the idea of getting younger guys—of course, it wasn’t formed  that way as an agency—and that’s one of the reasons the Agency was a lot better  in the ‘50s than I think it was later.They saddled themselves for security reasons, I  guess, among other things, with a career system in which people were supposed to  come in from universities.And a number of them just had undergraduate degrees.

[翻譯]
我的意思是，再說一次，存在的職業體制中其中一個主要問題是基於吸引年輕人的想法 - 當然，它成立時不是作為一個機構 - 這也是我認為60年代的機構比之後更好的原因之一。他們為了安全原因（我想，還有其他原因），困於一個人們應該從大學中進入的職業體制中。其中一些人只有學士學位。

And kind of progress up and kind of learn on the job, and so on.Well, you’re not  necessarily going to get great analysts out of them.- Q1: Particularly if you’re not paying attention to training.- Marshall: That’s right.So the big thing about Larry Gershwin was, first, he was technically better trained than most of the people they’d had looking at the missile  programs, or the strategic forces programs and he’d shown real analytic ability,  and was brought in by Harry Rowen at my suggestion.

[翻譯]
然後逐漸進步，然後在工作中學習，依此類推。嗯，你不一定會從他們身上得到優秀的分析師。-問題1：特別是如果你沒有關注培訓的話。- 馬歇爾：沒錯。所以拉里·格什溫最重要的一點是，首先，他在技術方面接受的培訓比他們許多負責研究飛彈計畫或戰略力量計畫的人更好，並且他展現出真正的分析能力，並且是在我建議下由哈利·魯文引進的。

--- 段落 424 (434 字元) ---
They have a fundamental  problem of just the intellectual capacity and analytic capabilities of the people  they have.That means you can organize, you can invest, you can do certain kinds  of things well with a career system of that sort, but there are other things you  can’t do very well.So you can run collection systems and so forth…American  intelligence is relatively strong on collection and weak on analysis.- Q1: To this day?

[翻譯]
他們所面臨的一個基本問題是其人員的智力能力和分析能力。這意味著你可以組織，可以投資，可以在某些方面做得很好，但有些事情你做不太好。所以你可以運作收集系統等等...美國情報在收集方面相對強大，但在分析方面較弱。-問題1：直到現在為止？

--- 段落 425 (479 字元) ---
- Marshall: I think so, but I don’t pay very much attention to it anymore.But I look at  it and it doesn’t seem any better, but I don’t pay that much attention.And then the other thing we called their attention to was some possibilities of  new training type techniques, this method developed at RAND, reproducing  scoring systems, to judge how much people really knew about areas, how good  they were at reporting, how certain or uncertain they were about the answers they gave.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我想是的，但我不再非常注意這個了。我看一下，感覺好像沒有改善，但我沒有那麼在意。然後我們還指出了一些新的訓練技術可能性，這種方法是在蘭德發展的，可以再現評分系統，來判斷人們對某些領域的了解程度，他們在報告時有多出色，對自己給出的答案有多確定或不確定。

--- 段落 426 (465 字元) ---
But all that just frightened them, they didn’t want anything to do with  anything.This was people down in the organization, not Tweedy.Later when I was working for Henry, and Chip Pickett and I—in fact you might  talk to Chip about it—we had all of these misgivings about the personnel system,  about training, and we tried to communicate some of those in a variety of ways  to the people out there.But, you know, they were not really that inclined to do  anything.

[翻譯]
但所有這些只是讓他們感到害怕，他們不想再有什麼關係。這些是組織中的人，而不是 Tweedy。後來當我在為亨利工作時，和 Chip Pickett 一起時，事實上你可能要和 Chip 談談這件事，我們對人事系統、培訓等方面都有很多顧慮，試圖以各種方式將這些溝通給外界的人們。但他們並不怎麼願意採取行動。

--- 段落 427 (372 字元) ---
I mean, that meant changing something that was very basic in the organization and it would take a lot of effort, it would be a really big change.When we did encourage some of this lateral entry—I encouraged Schlesinger in  that direction and he did a little bit of it… And then later, particularly under Casey,  still more of it was done.I don’t know what’s happening now.

[翻譯]
我是說，這意味著改變組織中非常基本的事情，這將需要大量的努力，這將是一個非常大的變革。當我們鼓勵某些橫向入口時 - 我鼓勵Schlesinger朝著這個方向前進，他也做了一點... 然後稍後，尤其是在Casey的領導下，做了更多的這方面的工作。我不知道現在發生了什麼事。

--- 段落 428 (483 字元) ---
- Q1: Did you have any role in preparing the new National Security Intelligence Directives (NSCIDs) that followed the Schlesinger report?- Marshall: Not that I remember, I don’t think so.It might well have been the special  group over in OMB, but I’m not actually sure who did the drafting.- Q1: The NSCIC just met once or twice?- Marshall: Yeah, probably.It may have met some after Kissinger and I left.But that’s  right, I can only remember one meeting, actually, when I was there.

[翻譯]
問1：您是否參與了準備隨著施萊辛格報告而來的新國家安全情報指令（NSCIDs）的任何角色？- 馬歇爾：就我記得來說，我不認為有。很可能是OMB裡的特別小組製定的，但我並不確定是誰實際起草的。- 問1：NSCIC只開過一兩次會議吧？- 馬歇爾：是的，可能是這樣。也許在基辛格和我離開後有開過一些。但沒錯，我只記得在我在那裡的時候開過一次會議。

--- 段落 429 (439 字元) ---
- Q1: Did the infrequent meetings of the NSCIC result in a lack of direction given to  the intelligence community by decisionmakers?- Marshall: When I tried to get from Kissinger, “Well, what do you really want” and so  on, we didn’t get very much.I mean we’d get these kind of gripes about how bad  the stuff is and so on, but you couldn’t get them to sit down and put together…  You might talk with Chip Pickett about that.He was around.

[翻譯]
Q1：NSCIC稀少的會議是否導致決策者未能給情報界明確方向？- 馬歇爾：當我試圖向基辛格問出，“你真正想要什麼”之類的問題時，我們得到的不太多。我意思是，我們會聽到一些關於情況多糟糕之類的抱怨，但你無法讓他們坐下來共同努力...你可以跟奇普·皮克特討論這件事。他就在附近。

--- 段落 430 (408 字元) ---
I can’t remember whether we tried to send out some kind of  request for a statement of what they most wanted.The only thing that, as I say,  worked was this survey I did of the NSC staff, and through them you get what  they would have liked and what they thought Kissinger would find useful.I sent  the results out to the people at CIA.- Q1: What did they do with it?- Marshall: At the moment, not very much.

[翻譯]
我記不得我們是否曾試圖發出某種要求，要求他們最想要的是什麼。正如我所說的，唯一有效的是我對國家安全委員會(NSC)工作人員所做的這項調查，通過他們，你可以知道他們想要什麼，以及他們認為基辛格會覺得有用的。我把調查結果發給中央情報局的人們。- Q1：他們拿來做了什麼？- 馬歇爾：目前，沒有太多作用。

There was one thing that was requested  by the people who followed the Soviet Union, which we put a special effort on.That was to create a new product, which was called something like “The Forum” or  something like that.Which was to come out maybe once a month and contain an  expression of views of people on some major controversy that existed.And they  hated it, and they continued it for a while and dropped it at the first opportunity.

[翻譯]
有一件事是蘇聯支持者提出的要求，我們非常努力去實現。那就是創造一個新產品，類似於“論壇”之類的東西。這個產品可能每個月出一次，包含人們對一些重大爭議的觀點。他們討厭這個產品，繼續了一段時間後，在第一個機會就放棄了它。

--- 段落 432 (469 字元) ---
But we did get to do it for about four, five, six months, something like that.- Q1: So there was just massive resistance across the board, or inertia?- Marshall: Right.Well, over time I think they’ve improved.They do some of their  own surveys now.I don’t think they’re as—And they have sent people around  to talk with people.And so they’ve picked up on some of it.I don’t know that it  really affects what they end up doing, that is the kind of products they produce.

[翻譯]
但我們確實做了大約四、五、六個月，類似這樣的事情。- 問題1：所以整個部門都存在巨大的阻力，或者是慣性嗎？- 馬歇爾：對的。嗯，隨著時間的推移，我認為他們已經有所改善。他們現在自己進行一些調查。我認為他們並不像...他們已經派人到處與人交談。因此他們有些收穫。我不知道這是否真的影響了他們最終所做的事情，也就是他們生產的產品。

--- 段落 433 (387 字元) ---
But they go through the process anyway.They didn’t do anything.They didn’t do  anything before.- Q1: You mentioned earlier that the Net Assessment Group was included in the intelligence reorganization document when it was brokered around by Smith and Haig.- Marshall: But it was not in my draft.- Q1: The March 1971 version of the Schlesinger report calls for a net assessment  function.

[翻譯]
但他們還是繼續進行流程。他們沒有做任何事情。他們以前什麼都沒做。- Q1：您之前提到網絡評估組（Net Assessment Group）被包含在情報重組文件中，當時由史密斯和海格簽署。- 馬歇爾：但這不在我的草稿中。- Q1：1971年3月版本的施萊辛格報告要求進行網絡評估功能。

- Marshall: I had forgotten about that, but it wasn’t, I know, in the other version that I  drafted that included recommendations.- Q1: Lionel Olmer gave a talk at Harvard in 1980 in which he claimed that the  President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) wanted net assessment  performed by the NSC, but that Kissinger was resistant.- Marshall: Well, as I told you, there were several sources of a push to do that.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我已經忘記了這件事，但在我起草包含建議的另一個版本中，我知道這樣做並不是。- Q1：Lionel Olmer在1980年在哈佛大學發表演講，他聲稱總統外國情報諮詢委員會(PFIAB)希望由NSC執行網絡評估，但基辛格卻持反對態度。- 馬歇爾：嗯，正如我告訴過你的，有幾個來源都在推動這樣做。

I think  I told you of these people who were involved in the Blue Ribbon Panel… The  three people that visited me from the Blue Ribbon Panel were on the staff.After  the fact, I talked with Ruben Mettler because I had been told that for the Blue  Ribbon Panel report that he had been the one that had pushed for this thing [net  assessment] within the DoD structure.But these people came over…and it was  before I finished.So it was early ‘70, probably March, maybe April.

[翻譯]
我想我曾告訴過你這些參與藍絲帶小組的人...從藍絲帶小組來拜訪我的三個人是工作人員。事實上，我和魯本·梅特勒交談過，因為我曾聽說他在藍絲帶小組報告中一直在推動國防部組織中的這件事情[淨評估]。但這些人過來了...而且那時我還沒結束。所以大概是70年代初，可能是三月或四月。

--- 段落 436 (419 字元) ---
They had somehow heard the fact that Henry had me doing this, came over, and lobbied for me  to put in my recommendations to him this reestablishment of a net assessment  group at the NSC.But I didn’t have any strong sense of— I didn’t personally feel  that that was the big thing.Maybe it would be good, maybe not, I don’t know.But  it didn’t fit with the things I was actually coming to, issues I was then addressing.

[翻譯]
他們不知何故聽說了亨利要我這樣做的事情，過來遊說我向他提出重建一個在國家安全委員會的淨評估小組的建議。但我並沒有明確感覺-我本人覺得這不是大事。也許這樣做會不錯，也許不會，我不知道。但這與我當時正在處理的議題沒有太大關聯。

- Q1: Was the 6 December 1971 directive from Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird  what you were referring to when you said that Laird issued a directive creating  a Director of Net Assessment at the Pentagon the day after Nixon’s intelligence  memo came out?- Marshall: Maybe we didn’t see this and maybe it took this time… But we knew right  away that he had decided to do this.…I forget how we knew.- Q1: Before that he hadn’t acted at all on the recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel?

[翻譯]
問1：你所指的是1971年12月6日國防部長梅爾文·萊爾德發出的指令，當時你說萊爾德在尼克松發出情報備忘錄後的第二天在五角大樓設立了一個網路評估主任嗎？- 馬歇爾：也許我們當時沒看到這個，也許花了這段時間... 但我們立即知道他已決定這樣做... 我忘了我們是怎麼知道的。-問1：在那之前，他對藍帶小組的建議完全沒有採取任何行動嗎？

--- 段落 438 (458 字元) ---
- Marshall: No, he had not.- Q1: Why do you think he was so opposed to setting up a net assessment function?- Marshall: I don’t know that he was strongly opposed.But he probably wasn’t  strongly for it.I don’t know.Actually, the most interesting guy to talk to about it is  dead—Fred Buzhardt.When I was over at the NSC trying to get the net assessment process started, he was one of the really helpful people at the Pentagon and  he was very close to Laird.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：不，他並沒有。
- Q1：你認為他為什麼如此反對建立一個網絡評估功能？
- 馬歇爾：我不知道他是否強烈反對。但他可能並不強烈支持。我不知道。事實上，最有趣的談論對象已經去世了—弗雷德·布茲哈特。當我在國家安全委員會試圖啟動網絡評估流程時，他是五角大樓中一位非常幫助的人，並且和萊爾德關係非常密切。

…But I don’t know who you could talk to about that.- Q1: What’s your general assessment of the result of the 1971 reorganization?- Marshall: Well, it’s so long ago, and so many other things have intervened.I don’t  know.It’s hard to—Certainly it changed eventually, but only eventually.

[翻譯]
...但我不知道你該和誰談論這件事。問題1：您對1971年重組的結果有什麼整體評價？- 馬歇爾：嗯，那是很久以前的事了，而且發生了很多其他事情。我不知道。很難說...當然最終是有變化的，但只是最終。

I mean in some areas—But it’s more this  matter of personnel, various people, like Gershwin, or some of the NIOs [National  Intelligence Officers] they’ve had in the general-purpose forces, I mean, Gorman was there for a while—sensible thing—the current guy— But I’m not close  enough to that set of organizations anymore to judge.But it certainly happened  very slowly.- Q1: But I mean from your perch at the NSC, when you were responsible for monitoring what was happening?

[翻譯]
在某些領域，更多的是人事問題，像是格什溫，或是一些在總合部隊擔任國家情報官的人，我是說，戈爾曼曾經在那裡待了一段時間，這是明智的做法，目前的那個人，但我已經不再緊密地與這些組織接觸了，無法評判。但這肯定是緩慢地發生的。問題1：但是從你在國家安全委員會的立場來看，你負責監測正在發生的事情，是這樣嗎？

--- 段落 442 (449 字元) ---
- Marshall: Oh, well, then, not very much happened at all.I mean it went very, very  slowly.I mean because Helms was being asked to take on responsibilities that he  didn’t really want.Set up new organizations like the IC staff.But it all went very  slowly, very slowly.And, as I say, two years later, which was essentially when I left,  not a lot had happened, I would say.- Q1: This was very helpful.- Marshall: Well, we can have further sessions.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：哦，那麼，其實沒有發生太多事情。我的意思是進展非常緩慢。因為海姆斯被要求承擔他其實不想要的職責。建立新組織，比如情報社員組。但一切進展得非常緩慢，非常緩慢。正如我所說的，兩年後，也就是我離開的時候，我想說並沒有太多事情發生。
- Q1：這很有幫助。

### 1969–1973

[翻譯]
1969年至1973年

### The Apollo Program was a series of manned missions to the moon conducted by the United States from 1969 to 1972. The program culminated in the successful landing of Apollo 11 on the moon on July 20, 1969. This was followed by several more missions, with Apollo 17 being the final mission to the moon in December 1972. Overall, the Apollo Program involved a total of 17 missions, with 12 astronauts setting foot on the moon.

阿波羅計劃是美國於1969年至1972年進行的一系列有人登月任務。該計劃在1969年7月20日取得成功，成功地將阿波羅11號著陸在月球上。此後還有幾次更多的任務，其中阿波羅17號是在1972年12月進行的最後一次登月任務。總體而言，阿波羅計劃共涉及17次任務，有12名宇航員登陸月球。

- Q1: So you joined the NSC full time in 1972 as head of the Net Assessment Group?- Marshall: ‘Course, I mean, initially it was just me.And then Carol Doheny.And then  I recruited Chip Pickett, who must have come in the summer [July ‘72], and then a  few months later, Robin Pirie.And then we had this other–Then Carol had gotten  Jo Hunerwadel assigned.But she was someone who came on as one of the  regular NSC secretaries.

[翻譯]
問1：您在1972年全職加入NSC，擔任網絡評估小組主任嗎？- 馬歇爾：當然，最初只有我。然後是卡羅爾·多尼。然後我招募了奇普·皮克特，他應該在夏季[1972年7月]進來，然後幾個月後，羅賓·皮里。然後我們有另外一個...之後卡羅爾讓喬·胡納韋德被分配過來。但她是作為一位常規NSC秘書加入的。

Then when Carol left, then she moved up to be the senior  secretary and we got this other secretary, Lexi Crow.And the five of us moved  over here.Let me say that one of the things that happened was that when I got the position  as head of the NSC Net Assessment Group, a number of people came around to  talk to me.Kind of give me advice.

[翻譯]
然後當卡羅離開後，她升任資深秘書，我們得到了另一位秘書，莉克西·克羅。我們五個人搬到這裡來。讓我說一件事情，當我擔任NSC網路評估組的負責人時，有許多人來找我談話，給我建議。

One of the most interesting was General Polk,  and I mentioned some other things about his insight from his own time as the  commander of the ground forces in Europe.His approach was driven by the fact  that he thought it was very important to know how effective these other forces  really were, something about their typical mistakes or failings, and so on, and etc.

And I guess the things I remember the most him talking about were these stories  that he got, and were indicative of the difficulties they had in movement—When  a unit was going to move from one place to the other, they would send out ahead  of them people that were almost the equivalent of traffic directors to make sure  they make the right turn at that crossroad, this crossroad.And then episodes of  them still getting lost, or making the wrong turn.

[翻譯]
我記得他談論最多的事情，是那些描述他們在移動中遇到困難的故事。當一個部隊要從一個地方移動到另一個地方時，他們會派出提前人員，他們幾乎相當於交通指揮員，以確保他們在十字路口和這個十字路口轉彎時走對路。然後離群索居或轉錯路的情況。

--- 段落 448 (458 字元) ---
These were all kind of indicators  to him of particular failings, problems that they were having.His point was that,  here he was, he was the commander of the American ground forces, and when  he asked his—down through his intelligence organizations, to tell him about  how good the opposing forces were, I mean qualitatively and so on, he was very  dissatisfied with what he got back.And that’s why he undertook this personal effort to find out for himself.

[翻譯]
這些都是對他某些失敗、問題的指示。他的觀點是，當他是美國陸地部隊的指揮官時，當他向情報組織詢問對手部隊的實力和質量時，他並不滿意所得到的回答。這就是為什麼他自己親自努力去尋找答案的原因。

--- 段落 449 (471 字元) ---
And I forget whether it was he or George Blanchard [a  subsequent commander of the American ground forces] telling me later of things  they thought about, planned to impress the Russian commander.Efforts were  made to invite the counterpart commander to come over and then to either in a  seemingly casual way or in a kind of staged way to kind of do things that would  impress him, like the speed at which certain kinds of actions could be taken and  executed and so on.

[翻譯]
我忘記是他還是喬治·布蘭查德（後來的美國地面部隊指揮官）告訴我後來他們考慮過的事情，計劃要給俄羅斯指揮官留下深刻印象。他們努力邀請對應的指揮官過來，然後以看似隨意的方式或某種安排好的方式做一些會令他印象深刻的事情，比如特定行動的速度和執行等等。

--- 段落 450 (285 字元) ---
I don’t remember specifically who [other than General] Polk came by to see me].But I was struck by the fact that all of a sudden there were a bunch of people  coming by to see me.- Q1: Could you talk about the review of combat models you did as part of the net  assessment work at NSC?

[翻譯]
我不記得具體是誰（除了波爾克將軍）來找我。但一件事讓我印象深刻，就是突然間有一大群人來找我。問題1：您能談談您在國安委員會做綜合評估工作時進行的戰鬥模型審查嗎？

--- 段落 451 (382 字元) ---
- Marshall: What I looked at was—To look at combat models—Well, I thought that  given what the fundamental task was, I wanted to see whether the models of  combat, and you know, at the, I suppose, division and above level, not very micro  combat, what the state of affairs was.Were they adequate?Would they reflect all of the factors that really ought to go into such an assessment?

[翻譯]
Marshall: 我所看的是 - 為了觀察戰鬥模型 - 嗯，我認為考慮到基本任務是什麼，我想要看看戰鬥模型是否足夠，你知道，大概在師級以上，不是非常微觀的戰鬥，局勢如何？它們是否足夠？是否反映了應該納入評估的所有因素？

--- 段落 452 (493 字元) ---
And so, I guess I  got briefed on the state of modeling and the existing models and fairly—First, I  more or less decided on my own, but I consulted with a number of people as to  their appraisal, and would the things really deal with the full range of factors that  ought to be taken into account, and decided that they weren’t going to be able  to.That, in particular, they didn’t take into account these kinds of levels of training,  morale, leadership, any of the more qualitative factors.

[翻譯]
因此，我猜我對建模的狀況和現有的模型有了初步了解。首先，我基本上是自己做出了決定，但我也諮詢了一些人對他們的評估，這些事情是否真的考慮了應該考慮的全部因素，最終我決定這些模型無法應對。特別是，它們沒有考慮到這些培訓水平、士氣、領導力等更具質量的因素。

--- 段落 453 (366 字元) ---
I remember talking with  General Polk about the state of the models.- Q1: You also conducted several intelligence case studies?- Marshall: The idea was—You know, it was one of the general tasks of this new NSC  Intelligence Committee to do these appraisals of the performance of the intelligence community.And we had started out with the performance in these crises.

[翻譯]
我記得和波克將軍談論模型的狀況。問題1：您也進行了幾個情報案例研究嗎？- 馬歇爾：這個想法是——您知道，這個新國家安全委員會情報委員會的一項主要任務是對情報界的表現進行評估。我們從這些危機中的表現開始著手。

--- 段落 454 (380 字元) ---
The studies of crises would have been done from…Beginning spring or summer  of ‘72 and done into the early part of ‘73—I mean the ones we had planned.The attempted overthrow of King Hussein and outside intervention in that crisis  was one of the case studies.The 1971 Indo-Pak war was another one.The other  case that I remember that we looked at was this…I forget the name of it.

[翻譯]
危機研究將會從...從1972年春季或夏季開始，一直進行到1973年初 - 我的意思是我們計劃好的那些。企圖推翻侯賽因國王和外部干預這場危機是其中一個案例。1971年印巴戰爭是另一個案例。我記得我們看過的另一個案例是......我忘記它的名字了。

--- 段落 455 (498 字元) ---
But  there was this period when there was this canal zone area in which the Egyptians  were supposedly not to—That the demilitarized strip, I guess, on the other side of  the canal—And they were not supposed to move into this area.But they began  surreptitiously to do so.And the issue was how well American intelligence was  able to monitor that—as I remember that.You ought to talk with Chip about  that, but I think…But I don’t remember NSSM 69 as being something that we  were that involved in.

[翻譯]
但是有一段時間，埃及有一個運河區域，據說埃及人不應該進入-我想是運河另一邊的非軍事化區域-他們不應該進入這個區域。但他們卻偷偷地這麼做了。問題是美國情報部門能否監控得宜-就我所記得的。你應該和Chip談談這個問題，但我記不得NSSM 69是我們參與的事情。

--- 段落 456 (456 字元) ---
But there was a phrase for this encroachment back into this  demilitarized zone.I don’t remember the specific insights from the case studies.But the things led  to a certain number of proposals of things that ought to be done in order to  do better in the future and so on.But as to the major insights, I guess that I felt  that what came out of it was this thing you mentioned [that the analysts did not  have the same perspective as Nixon and Kissinger].

[翻譯]
但對於重新侵犯這個非軍事區域的行為，有一個詞語。我不記得案例研究中的具體見解。但這些事情導致了一些提議，應該做一些事情以便在未來做得更好等等。但就主要看法來說，我想我覺得從中得出的是你提到的這件事情【分析師與尼克森和基辛格沒有相同的觀點】。

--- 段落 457 (362 字元) ---
But also how difficult it was  to get the intelligence community people to really do objective assessments of  their own performance.The first draft almost uniformly came back, Given all the  circumstances, we did well, even if it was manifest that they hadn’t done very well.They always had some out; you know, the circumstances prevented them from  doing well.

[翻譯]
但同時，讓情報界人員真正客觀評估自己的表現有多困難。第一份草稿幾乎普遍回來說，考慮到所有情況，我們表現不錯，即使顯然他們的表現並不是很好。他們總是有著藉口；你知道，情況使他們無法表現得好。

--- 段落 458 (485 字元) ---
So we usually had to go through two or three drafts before you could  finally get them to be a bit more objective and really do an appraisal from which  there would be some admission that this or that didn’t go so well and maybe  something that could be done about it.- Q1: You commented in the past that the post-mortems found a lack of objectivity  by the staff drawn from operating organizations; perishable data; lack of access to  top officials; sensitivity of certain activities.

[翻譯]
因此，通常我們必須經過兩三次草稿才能最終讓他們更客觀，並真正做出一個評估，從中會有一些承認這一點或那一點沒有做得那麼好，也許有些事情可以做出改進。Q1：您過去曾評論過，事後檢討發現運營組織的工作人員缺乏客觀性；易腐敗數據；無法接觸高級官員；某些活動的敏感性。

--- 段落 459 (366 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yeah, I think there was a memo around here, there was probably something written toward the very end of—You know, what did we learn from this  whole thing and so on.- Q1: And the case studies were followed by the study of intelligence in the 1973  Arab-Israeli War?- Marshall: And then along came this other event in ‘73, that we then took advantage  of.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：對，我想這裡應該有一份備忘錄，可能是在整個事情結束時留下的一些文字—你知道，我們從這個整個事件中學到了什麼之類的。 
- Q1：這些案例研究後，接著是對1973年阿拉伯以色列戰爭情報的研究嗎？ 
- 馬歇爾：然後在1973年出現了另一個事件，我們更進一步利用了這個機會。

--- 段落 460 (399 字元) ---
And we did the Arab-Israeli War study because one of the difficulties that we’d  found in doing the earlier assessments was that you often couldn’t really find out  which intelligence document or bits of things had actually reached particular  people, whether they had read them or not, and so on.So this was an attempt to  have a better feel for what materials actually reached the relevant people.

[翻譯]
我們進行阿拉伯以色列戰爭的研究，是因為我們發現在做早期評估時所遇到的一個困難是，往往無法確切得知哪些情報文件或訊息碎片實際上達到了特定的人，他們是否閱讀了這些資料等等。因此，這是為了更好地了解哪些資料實際上達到了相關的人的一個嘗試。

--- 段落 461 (448 字元) ---
And  then also to interview them while the thing’s going on as to how useful and so on  the stuff was.The study was done almost in real time.Talk more with Chip Pickett.And actually, you see, Chip stayed on after the rest of the group came over here,  because our movement over here was not too much afterwards.And he stayed  on to finish the report and then came over.So he was a lot more involved.He’d be  the better person to talk to about that.

[翻譯]
然後也要在做這件事情的同時訪問他們，了解這些東西有多有用等等。這項研究幾乎是實時進行的。與Chip Pickett深入交談。事實上，你看，Chip在其他團員過來這裡後留了下來，因為我們過來這裡的運動之後不久。他留下來完成報告然後過來。所以他參與得更深。他是更合適的人選來談論這個。

--- 段落 462 (390 字元) ---
But at any rate, so we’d been looking at one aspect of the performance of the  community, and I think at some meeting of the second level of this thing, the  working group [of the NSCIC], discussed, Well, what other areas could we look at.And one area was the quality of political and economic intelligence.And then the  question was, OK, we need to pick a country or some place to look at.

[翻譯]
但無論如何，我們一直在研究社區的表現方面，我想在這個事情的第二層次會議上，NSCIC的工作小組討論了，好吧，我們可以再研究哪些領域。其中一個領域是政治和經濟情報的質量。然後問題出來了，好的，我們需要選擇一個國家或某個地方進行研究。

--- 段落 463 (465 字元) ---
And then  several proposals were made and Yugoslavia was picked, because at the time,  even though it didn’t happen until much later, again there was some speculation  that Tito—I forget whether it was his health or what it was—but he might leave  soon.And so, it was a kind of case of, or a situation in which you would like to  have good information about these things.So, we then undertook this effort and, I guess as I remember it, we collected all this  stuff.

[翻譯]
然後提出了幾個提案，最終選擇了南斯拉夫，因為當時，儘管直到後來才發生，人們又有一些猜測認為，可能是提特（Tito）的健康狀況或其他原因，但他可能會很快離開。因此，這是一種情況，或者說是一種情況，您希望對這些事情有良好的信息。因此，我們開始了這一努力，我想我記得，我們收集了所有這些資料。

--- 段落 464 (437 字元) ---
You know, recent intelligence or probably from the prior couple of years or  so.And the materials, both various studies, or major papers, as well as current intelligence…We went and tried to understand, “Who were the people who prepared  this?” particularly at CIA, and some of their characteristics, I mean, did they really  know anything about Yugoslavia.I mean, what was the basis of their knowledge.- Q1: What yardsticks did you use?

[翻譯]
你知道的，最近的情報可能來自前幾年。還有相關研究、重要文件和最新的情報...我們試著理解“是誰準備了這些資料？”，特別是在中央情報局，以及一些他們的特點，我是說，他們真的了解南斯拉夫嗎？他們的知識基礎是什麼？- 問題1：你們使用了哪些標準？

--- 段落 465 (157 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, whether they had previous experience, had ever lived in the country,  knew any of the languages, you know.But we had this body of material.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：那麼，無論他們是否有先前的經驗，是否曾在該國生活過，是否懂得任何語言，你知道。但我們擁有這些資料。

--- 段落 466 (465 字元) ---
And then  we had some people from the outside—and I forget who they all were, except for  a couple of them that I—although they weren’t the only ones—For the economics stuff, the one person I remember involving was Joe Kirchheimer, who was a  friend of mine and secondly, a partner in Burnham & Company on Wall Street, had  been in the CIA in the ‘50s, had been in military intelligence in the war.- Q1: In other words, he was very qualified.- Marshall: Yes, right.

[翻譯]
然後我們有一些外部人士，我忘記他們都是誰，除了我記得其中幾個，雖然他們不是唯一的幾個。在經濟方面，我記得參與的一個人是我的朋友約瑟·基爾希默，他是華爾街Burnham＆Company的合夥人，在50年代曾在中央情報局工作，也曾在戰爭中擔任軍事情報工作。換句話說，他非常有資格。-問題1: 是的，對。

--- 段落 467 (454 字元) ---
He was one of the people we had look at the—But he wasn’t  the only one.There were two or three other people.We had a little panel of two  or three people for each, separately, for the economics and the political.And on  the political side, I remember that one of the people was Nathan Leites.But I can’t  quite remember who the other people were.And, in essence, we got pretty negative reviews from the panel after reading all  this stuff.In both cases.

[翻譯]
他是我們找來的人之一，但他並不是唯一的一個。還有兩三個其他人。對於經濟和政治，我們每個方面都有一個由兩至三人組成的小組。在政治方面，我記得其中一個人是Nathan Leites。但我不太記得其他人是誰。總的來說，在閱讀了所有這些東西後，我們從小組那裡得到了相當負面的評論。在兩個案例中都是這樣。

--- 段落 468 (473 字元) ---
In the case of the economic material…just thought that  there was better material that could be available to people in the government  from the banks on Wall Street, is the most particular thing I meant, but there were  undoubtedly other sources.And then for the political analysis, it was just felt that  there was very good reporting in Swiss and German newspapers, and just translating the articles from the better newspapers would be a lot better than the stuff  there.

[翻譯]
在經濟材料的情況下...只是覺得政府官員可以從華爾街的銀行獲得更好的材料，這就是我所意指的最具體的事情，但無疑還有其他來源。然後對於政治分析，只是感覺瑞士和德國報紙有很好的報導，只需翻譯來自更好報紙的文章會比那些材料好得多。

--- 段落 469 (415 字元) ---
Now, of course, there would be a tiny bit of material based on some special  intelligence, say, that the newspapers wouldn’t necessarily have.But it would  be—The bulk of what these people tried to write about was done far better by  people out in the real world.- Q1: And these outside sources had been ignored, neglected by the intelligence  community?- Marshall: Well, probably.Yeah, I doubt that they read them.

[翻譯]
現在，當然，會有一點點基於某些特殊情報的材料，比如報紙可能沒有的。但主要的部分是這些人試圖寫的，實際上在現實世界裡由其他人做得更好。- Q1：這些外部來源被情報部門忽略，忽視了嗎？- 馬歇爾：很可能。是的，我懷疑他們沒有讀這些。

--- 段落 470 (321 字元) ---
Well, in the first place, again, Yugoslavia—Well, it turned out that the people who  did this were part of the current intelligence people at CIA.Again, I think the  reporting from the clandestine service people at the embassy and so on would  have not had some of these difficulties.But these panels didn’t look at that.

[翻譯]
首先，關於南斯拉夫，結果證明進行這項活動的人員是中央情報局當前的情報人員。我認為，來自大使館的秘密服務人員的報告可能不會遇到這些困難。但是這些委員會並未考慮這一點。

--- 段落 471 (446 字元) ---
They  looked at the part that came out of the so-called intelligence analysis…But that  was done by people in the current intelligence part of CIA, and there, particularly  for countries like Yugoslavia, it was treated like almost a newspaper.There was the  Yugoslavian desk, and there would be two or three people on it.But they moved  from that to other jobs, or from other jobs to that.But they had no prior experience dealing with Yugoslavia.

[翻譯]
他們看了所謂的情報分析中出現的部分...但那是由CIA當前情報部門的人員完成的，尤其是對於像南斯拉夫這樣的國家，這些分析幾乎就像是報紙一樣。有南斯拉夫辦公桌，辦公桌上可能有兩三個人。但他們從那轉移到其他工作，或從其他工作轉移到那裡。但他們沒有任何處理南斯拉夫問題的先驗經驗。

--- 段落 472 (396 字元) ---
They only tended to—At the moment we wrote the  report, the years of even being on that desk, the average for the three people was  a year and a half.So they weren’t there long enough to get great know-how.They  probably didn’t read German.So sending them to German and Swiss newspapers  was not going to help unless there were some readily available translations.They  didn’t know the languages.

[翻譯]
他們只是傾向於-在我們撰寫報告的當下，三個人在那個崗位上的平均是一年半，所以他們還沒有足夠的時間去累積豐富的專業知識。他們可能不懂德語。因此，將他們派到德國和瑞士的報紙也無濟於事，除非有現成的翻譯版本。他們不懂這些語言。

--- 段落 473 (488 字元) ---
And it was again an insight to me that—And we talked to one of the people on  the NSC, who actually was the recipient of this stuff, the intelligence stuff, who  had twice served in Yugoslavia, in the embassy, and so he had about nine years  or so of on-the-spot experience in Yugoslavia.So it was an example to me of how  wrong—There was this book called Organizational Intelligence or something, I  forget the name of the author now.- Q1: Wilensky?- Marshall: Yeah, some name like that.

[翻譯]
這對我來說又是一個領悟——我們和國家安全委員會的一名成員交談過，實際上他是這些情報資料的接收者，曾在領館兩次在南斯拉夫服役，所以他在南斯拉夫有大約九年的實地經驗。這對我來說是一個例子，說明了我們多麼錯誤——有一本書叫做《組織情報》之類的，作者的名字我現在忘了。- Q1: 威倫斯基嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，類似那樣的名字。

--- 段落 474 (460 字元) ---
But the point is—Walinsky or Wilensky—89 See  the people…The kind of academic theorists sort of treat the world as being that  there are these people, the real experts, and things are filtered up to other people  who are not really in touch with the real world and also don’t know very much  about it.And that the problem in organizations is that the people who really know  certain kinds of things, some part of it gets filtered out as it moves up to the top.

[翻譯]
但重點是 - Walinsky或Wilensky - 看到人們...這種學術理論家將世界看作是這樣的，那些真正的專家，事情被過濾給其他人，這些人與真實世界不太接觸，也對它沒有太多了解。組織中的問題是，真正了解某些事物的人，部分內容在傳遞到最高層時會被過濾掉。

--- 段落 475 (349 字元) ---
Here you had this case of the people down below just don’t know very much,  don’t have much interpretive skill, sending stuff up to, in this case, someone who actually had a good deal of experience and knew more about the country than  they did.And it’s the product of the personnel systems in the intelligence community for these smaller countries.

[翻譯]
這裡有一個案例，下面的人們並不了解很多，也沒有很強的解釋能力，他們將情報發送給一個實際上有相當經驗且比他們更了解該國的人。這是情報圈子中較小國家的人員系統的產物。

--- 段落 476 (476 字元) ---
I mean in the case of—If you have other kinds  of situations, where people can specialize for a long time, as in the case of Russia  and so on, it’s not as big a contrast.- Q1: Back on the Yugoslavia review.When was that done roughly?- Marshall: I think that was probably done in the spring of ‘73, would be my guess.- Q1: What impact do you think these different studies had or how were they used?- Marshall: Well, you know, again, they were sent out from this NSC committee.

[翻譯]
我的意思是，在某些情況下─如果存在其他類型的情況，人們可以長時間專門從事，就像俄羅斯等國家一樣，這並沒有那麼大的對比。─問題1：回顧南斯拉夫時，大致是什麼時候進行的？─馬歇爾：我想那個大概是在1973年春天進行的。這只是我的猜測。─問題1：您認為這些不同的研究有什麼影響或者它們如何使用？─馬歇爾：嗯，你知道，再說一次，這些都是由這個國家安全委員會委託發出的。

--- 段落 477 (465 字元) ---
First,  to the members on the committee itself, because they were done by the working  group.So all the major organizations were represented there…Well, I guess not  all, because I guess NSA wasn’t on it or so on.But then it went out.But you know,  again, it’s just another report and I don’t think very much happened as a result of  that.But Chip would be good on this, I mean he was the main collaborator…  
- Q1: On all of these studies, rather than Robin Pirie?

[翻譯]
首先，對於委員會內部的成員來說，因為是由工作組完成的。因此，所有主要組織都在其中代表……嗯，我猜不是所有組織，因為我猜 NSA 不在其中，或者其他組織也不在。但後來它被公布出來了。但是你知道，再說一次，這只是另一份報告，我認為並沒有太多事情發生作為結果。但是 Chip 在這方面很擅長，我的意思是他是主要的合作者…
- Q1：在所有這些研究中，而不是 Robin Pirie？

--- 段落 478 (353 字元) ---
- Marshall: Oh yeah, Robin was off…We were trying to get the net assessment part  of it going.- Q1: In your notes, you wrote: “History: — HAK • GPF [general-purpose forces] backup plan, leads to CIA work.”  
- Marshall: Well, I would guess—There had been this work that was done for Kissinger  in the summer of ‘70, you know, the initial net assessment.

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾：噢是的，羅賓離開了…我們試圖讓評估網絡的部分進行。
- Q1：在你的筆記中，你寫道：“歷史：- HAK • GPF [一般用途部隊]應急計劃，導致中央情報局的工作。”
- 馬歇爾：我想…基辛格在1970年夏天曾為此進行過工作，你知道，最初的網絡評估。

--- 段落 479 (496 字元) ---
And the whole motive  that he had was that he wanted this study done in order to have some things in  his hip pocket, so to speak, of programs that could be either augmented or so on,  etc., that would be worthwhile, if things did not go well with the Soviets and new  monies were available and…  So part of the background was that, OK, if you’re going to have these—This idea  that if things go badly you’re going to start some new things, they might as well  be things that would be impressive.

[翻譯]
他的整個動機是希望這項研究能夠有所準備，以便在蘇聯方面出現不利情況並有新的資金可用時，能夠進行一些相應的計劃。因此，背景的一部分是，如果情況惡化，將開展一些新的事物，最好是一些具有印象力的事物。

--- 段落 480 (384 字元) ---
- Q1: Now is this if things went badly in SALT or just a general deterioration in our  relations with…?- Marshall: I forget now what was worrying Kissinger.I suppose it was SALT or just  general behavior that kind of things…  
- Q1: There was a stalemate in the SALT talks around the time you started work on the  net assessment study and also there were the crises discussed earlier.

[翻譯]
問題1：這是因為SALT出了問題還是我們與某些關係普遍惡化了...？- 馬歇爾：我忘了基辛格當時擔心的是什麼。我想可能是SALT或者一般的行為那種事情...
問題1：在你開始進行網絡評估研究時，SALT談判陷入僵局，同時前面討論過的危機也在發生。

--- 段落 481 (454 字元) ---
- Marshall: But in any case, I had had this—From the beginning on this idea of the  net assessments—That is, that clearly one of the ways…One of our goals was  deterring the Soviets from various kinds of actions, encroachments, and so on.And that it would be important to understand, what did they pay attention to,  where did they give us good marks, where did they not give us good marks.And  so, once I had joined Kissinger, I thought more about that.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：但無論如何，從一開始我就有這個想法，即網絡評估——顯然，其中一種方式…我們的目標之一是遏止蘇聯進行各種行動、侵犯等等。了解他們關注的事項、給我們哪些好評、哪些不給好評是非常重要的。所以，一旦我加入基辛格，我就更多地思考這個問題。

--- 段落 482 (455 字元) ---
And then asked that  this study be done to make an attempt to answer those kinds of questions.- Q1: And what were the findings?I know it [the study] was completed after you  moved to the Pentagon.- Marshall: Well, as I remember it, I think there were a couple of reports that came  out…Again, I remember that there were some things that came out…There  certainly was some insights as to what it was they seemed particularly to pay  attention to and so on.

[翻譯]
然後要求進行這研究，試圖回答這些問題。問題1：結果是什麼？我知道這個研究是在你搬到五角大廈後完成的。馬歇爾：我記得，我想當時有幾份報告出來了...我記得當時有一些東西出來...他們似乎特別關注的事情也有一些啟示。

--- 段落 483 (492 字元) ---
But I don’t remember the details of the thing.But as I  remember, I thought the things were OK, and yet they were seen as difficult to  do, and the guy who did them I think moved on to something else, and they were  never kind of continued.- Q1: But there was just one person working on them?- Marshall: Yeah, right.90  
- Q1: Do you remember why Kissinger wanted the study of the Chinese ballistic  missile program done?- Marshall: No.In fact, it had been ordered before I had come on board.

[翻譯]
但是我不記得這件事的細節。但據我記得，我認為這些事情是可以搞定的，但被視為難以做到，而做這些事情的那個人我想轉而從事其他事情了，所以這些事情也沒有持續下去。- Q1：但是只有一個人在做這些事情嗎？- 馬歇爾：對。- Q1：你記得為什麼基辛格希望進行中國彈道導彈計劃的研究嗎？- 馬歇爾：不記得。實際上，這個命令在我上任之前就已經下達了。

--- 段落 484 (330 字元) ---
But it was one  of the first things that came in, when I came on board in early January of ‘72.And it  was one of the things that I was asked to evaluate.Well, also it was a special study  that had been asked for by him.And I don’t remember what triggered it.I remember reviewing it and sending up an appraisal of it to Kissinger.

[翻譯]
當我在1972年初加入時，這是其中一件最早出現的事情之一。這也是我被要求評估的事情之一。同時，這也是他要求進行的特別研究之一。我不記得是什麼觸發了這個研究。我記得審查了它並向基辛格提交了一份評估。

--- 段落 485 (489 字元) ---
And then…The thing  that was so ironic about it was that, here in this study they, in effect, say that they  haven’t deployed the missiles yet…At that time they believed that the Chinese  hadn’t deployed any missiles [MRBMs, IRBMs or ICBMs].That they hadn’t been  deployed, and went into a long story about why they were so sure in saying, we  would have seen this, we would have seen that.And all based on the assumption  that they would proceed very much the way we and the Russians had.

[翻譯]
然後...最具諷刺意味的是，在這個研究中，他們實際上表示他們還沒有部署導彈...當時他們相信中國尚未部署任何導彈[中程彈道飛彈、中程射程彈道飛彈或洲際彈道飛彈]。他們還講述了一個關於為什麼如此確定他們尚未被部署的長篇故事，並且認為我們會看到這個，我們會看到那個。所有這些都是建立在他們會以我們和俄羅斯人相同的方式進行的假設上。

--- 段落 486 (422 字元) ---
And then a  relatively few months—within six months, I think—they had to come in and say,  “Whoops, we now know they’ve been deployed more than that.They have been  deployed since about 1965.Now that we see what they’re doing” and so on, etc.- Q1: This is because they’re road-mobile missiles and they’re dispersed?- Marshall: Well, they’re different in their—Right—and they’re hidden in a variety  of ways and so on, etc.

[翻譯]
然後在相對較短的幾個月之內，我認為在六個月內，他們不得不進來說：“哎呀，我們現在知道它們已經部署了更長時間。它們自1965年左右就開始投入使用。現在我們看到它們做了什麼”等等。問題1：這是因為它們是路移式導彈，且被分散部署嗎？- 馬歇爾：嗯，它們在不同方面是不同的-對，它們是以各種方式隱藏的等等。

--- 段落 487 (473 字元) ---
And obviously the Chinese had taken great care to be far  more deceptive about the whole business than either we or the Russians actually  had been.And, very likely, in my judgment, because they were actually apprehensive about the Russian reaction had it been detected.- Q1: Possible attack.- Marshall: Yeah.- Q1: But the problem, was it that the CIA was saying, “Well, here’s the setup of the  missile at the test site, and that we don’t see that duplicated in the field.

[翻譯]
顯然，中國人對整個情況比我們或俄羅斯人更加謹慎保密。在我看來，很可能是因為他們實際上對俄羅斯的反應感到擔憂，如果發現了這一行為。- Q1：可能的攻擊。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q1：但問題是，是中央情報局在說：「在試驗場的飛彈設置方式，我們在現場看不到它的複製。

--- 段落 488 (423 字元) ---
And so,  therefore, it hasn’t been deployed?”  
- Marshall: Well, or that they’ve had certain kinds of tests, but, you know, that they  probably would deploy—We would see at the test site the kind of silos, the kind  of things that they would eventually deploy.And we don’t see that.We don’t see  any deployed systems that match anything.We don’t see anything that looks like  what we see at the test sites, and so on, etc.

[翻譯]
因此，它還沒有被部署嗎？
- 馬歇爾：嗯，或者他們進行過某些測試，但你知道，他們可能會部署一些——我們會在測試場地看到那種發射井、那種最終會被部署的東西。但我們沒有看到。我們沒有看到任何與之相符的部署系統。我們沒有看到任何看起來像我們在測試場地看到的東西，依此類推。

--- 段落 489 (166 字元) ---
- Q1: Do you remember if the misestimate of the size of the SS-19 ICBM occurred  during the May ‘72 Moscow summit?- Marshall: No, I don’t think it occurred during it.

[翻譯]
Q1：您是否記得SS-19洲際彈道飛彈尺寸的錯估發生在1972年5月的莫斯科峰會期間嗎？- 馬歇爾：不，我不認為它是在那時發生的。

--- 段落 490 (642 字元) ---
But it—The reason I remember it  was there was a strong reaction on Haig’s part, I think, because we were making,  in the negotiations, a big point of some particular measure of size, and if what this  new revelation meant, and everything, that this had been set—the size thing—  had been set based on our notions of the earlier estimate of the size, which was  smaller…And so, in effect, we either said, we were kind of complicating the negotiation by trying to force on them a size category which meant that the –19 would  be, in fact, a big missile, or you’re forcing them to lie and to… At any rate…  
- Q1: And Haig was upset about this?

[翻譯]
但我記得的原因是海格對此有強烈的反應，因為在談判中，我們對某個特定尺寸的重要性進行了強調，而這個新的揭示意味著，這件事情是基於我們對之前尺寸估計的概念來設立的，而該估計是較小的... 因此，事實上，我們要麼說，我們試圖在談判中強行將一個尺寸類別強加給他們，這意味著19號將事實上是一枚大導彈，要麼你們要逼他們說謊和... 無論如何... -問題1：海格為此感到不滿？

--- 段落 491 (307 字元) ---
- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q1: But the main point was that these were just examples of where the intelligence  community got things wrong?- Marshall: Yeah, right.- Q1: What were the general contents of the five-page handwritten letter you wrote  to Schlesinger when he became Director of Central Intelligence?

[翻譯]
- 馬歇爾: 是的，沒錯。- Q1: 但主要問題在於，這些只是情報界失誤的案例嗎？- 馬歇爾: 是的，沒錯。- Q1: 當你寫了一封五頁手寫信給謝辛格成為中央情報局局長時，信的內容是什麼？

--- 段落 492 (461 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, the main thing I guess I recall about it was kind of saying to him—  ‘Course Schlesinger already, because of his previous position at OMB, where he’d  overseen a lot of—I mean the people who monitored intelligence were under  him and so on.And I, of course, had talked with him from time to time anyway  about it.But I guess the main thrust of the letter was to say to him, “Look, this is an  organization which isn’t as good as it used to be.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，我想我記得的主要事情是向他說的。當然，由於謝辛格先前在OMB的職位，他監督了許多情報監察人員等。我當然也時不時地和他談過這個問題。但我想信的主要目的是告訴他：“看，這個組織已經不像以前那樣好了。

--- 段落 493 (428 字元) ---
It has a lot of problems,” and try  to outline a number of problems based on the experience that I had had of the  inadequacies in the analysis area, its tendency to isolate itself from the outside  world in terms of very little lateral entry, all of that.I just kind of laid all that out for  him, as to the kind of place he was taking over and what seemed to be the kind of  major problems, the obstacles to change, and so on.

[翻譯]
它有很多問題，而根據我在分析領域中遇到的不足之處和其在與外界隔絕方面的傾向（即缺乏橫向進入），我試著概述一系列問題。我就把這些都向他說明了，關於他即將接手的地方的性質，以及似乎存在的主要問題、改變的障礙等等。

--- 段落 494 (434 字元) ---
- Q1: Even at the NSC, you were criticizing the intelligence community for its estimates of the Soviet defense burden.- Marshall: Yes.- Q1: And what do you remember about your work on that subject while you were at  the NSC?- Marshall: Well, it was…I mean I didn’t do very much about it there, as compared  with later, when I came here.But I had had doubts about it back at RAND.In fact,  Schlesinger and I had talked some about that.

[翻譯]
Q1：即使在國家安全委員會，你也批評情報界對蘇聯國防負擔的估計。- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q1：在你在國家安全委員會期間對這個主題的工作，你還記得些什麼？- 馬歇爾：嗯，那個…我在那裡沒有做太多，與後來我來這裡時相比，但我在RAND時就對此懷疑過。事實上，施萊辛格和我曾經談論過這個問題。

--- 段落 495 (315 字元) ---
And we also talked about it when  we did that net assessment for Kissinger in the summer of ‘70, or probably early  fall.And it just was unbelievable that they could produce the size of military  effort, be modernizing at the kind of pace they seemed to be, all on six percent  of a GNP which was smaller than ours.

[翻譯]
當我們在1970年夏季，或者可能是初秋為基辛格做網絡評估時，我們也談到了這個問題。他們憑著不到我們國家總生產的6%的GNP，就能夠產生如此規模的軍事努力，並且以他們看似的速度進行現代化，這簡直是不可思議的。

--- 段落 496 (464 字元) ---
Again, it was based on the notion that it  was about half ours, for the moment, accepting that the GNP was about the size  that the CIA said it was, which would make it about half of the U.S.GNP.With only  six percent of that being allocated, which would be roughly the equivalent of three percent of our GNP, that they could produce this very large set of military  programs.So Schlesinger and I felt that there was something doubtful about that,  going way back.

[翻譯]
再次強調，這是基於一個觀念，即目前大約一半的 GNP 屬於我們，暫時接受 CIA 所說的 GNP 大小，這將使其大約是美國 GNP 的一半。只有其中的百分之六被分配出去，這大約相當於我們 GNP 的百分之三，他們可以推出這麼龐大的一系列軍事項目。所以 Schlesinger 和我認為這件事有些疑問，這已經追溯很久了。

--- 段落 497 (347 字元) ---
And nothing I learned made me feel any better about it.- Q1: But this wasn’t something that you studied, I mean a formal study or asking the  intelligence community to relook, look at it again at that time.- Marshall: No.That was done largely here, initially when Schlesinger came here and  we started pressing this as one of the issues with them.

[翻譯]
但我所學到的任何事情都沒有讓我對此感到更好。問題1：但這不是你所研究的事情，我的意思是一項正式的研究或要求情報界重新審視它，當時並不是這樣的。 - 馬歇爾：不是，當施萊辛格到達這裡，我們與他們一起一開始壓迫這個作為其中之一的問題。

--- 段落 498 (476 字元) ---
Which led to their relook  at it, and coming back to us in, I suppose, ‘74, with this special memorandum, it  wasn’t a regular report, it came back initially as just a memorandum to Schlesinger, that we’ve looked at it, and we think the errors, we still believe the number and  the errors would be very small on either side of it.Q1: You had thought that the 1966 paper on Problems of Estimating Military Power  might have been related to work for Fred Wikner.- Marshall: Yes.

[翻譯]
這導致他們重新審視此事，並在我們應該是在74年提出了這份特別的備忘錄，這不是一份常規報告，它最初只是一份提交給施萊辛格的備忘錄，其中提到我們已經檢查過，我們認為錯誤數量及錯誤在此之外可能都很小。Q1：您曾認為1966年關於估算軍事力量問題的文件可能與弗雷德·維克納的工作有關。- 馬歇爾：是的。

--- 段落 499 (483 字元) ---
- Q1: But really the other work that you did—and I’ll talk with him—  
- Marshall: Is later.- Q1: Much, much later.- Marshall: Well, so probably wasn’t, yeah.So, I suppose it must have just come out  of the, at one level, the work that I had been doing for a long time with Loftus,  although that had pretty much stopped at that point.Loftus and I put out some  final reports I think that we did together in ‘63.Then I went off to France.Didn’t return until February or March of ‘65.

[翻譯]
- Q1：但實際上，你做的另一項工作——我會跟他談談——  
- 馬歇爾：是稍後。- Q1：要過很長時間。- 馬歇爾：那麼，可能不是，對吧。所以，我想這可能是源於我與羅夫特長期合作的工作，盡管當時這項工作基本上已經停止了。我們在'63年一起完成了一些最終報告。然後我去了法國。直到1965年的二月或三月才回來。

--- 段落 500 (479 字元) ---
And one of the main things that I  wanted to pick up at that point was trying to apply whatever was known about  organizations, organizational behavior.Which interest, in a way, had started in  the work with Loftus, had started back in the late ‘50s.And we did spend a lot of  time, or I spent a lot of time, thinking about how to understand the Soviets from  that perspective.But exactly why that thing [Problems of Estimating Military Power]  looks the way it is, I don’t know.

[翻譯]
在那個時候，我想要學習的主要事情之一是試圖應用已知的組織和組織行為的知識。這種興趣在與洛夫特斯的合作中已經開始，而這是在50年代末開始的。我們花了很多時間，或者我個人花了很多時間，思考如何從這個角度了解蘇聯。但關於為什麼《評估軍事力量的問題》看起來是這個樣子，我並不清楚。

--- 段落 501 (466 字元) ---
Or why the topic is exactly what it is.- Q1: As Director of Strategic Studies at RAND, you were responsible for sort of  integrating the efforts related to strategic forces that were done in the different  departments at RAND?- Marshall: Yes.- Q1: So this was a new layer of management?- Marshall: Yes, it was a new thing that had come out of discussions that Schlesinger  and I had had with Rowen, which led to Rowen initially asking Schlesinger to  undertake this.

[翻譯]
為什麼這個主題正是它存在的原因。- Q1：作為蘭德公司戰略研究主任，您負責整合在蘭德公司不同部門進行的有關戰略力量的工作嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的。- Q1：這樣一來，這是一個新的管理層嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，這是由施萊辛格和我與羅文討論後產生的新事物，這促使羅文最初要求施萊辛格進行這項工作。

--- 段落 502 (492 字元) ---
And he did that for, maybe realistically, for six months.He hadn’t  gotten very far along in it when the 1968 election came along, and then he came  back on some of the transition team things and then ended up going into the  government here.So Rowen asked me to take it on.That was in early ‘69, I think,  because initially, when Schlesinger came back here during the transition period,  it wasn’t known whether he’d come back.The expectation initially was that he  would probably come back.

[翻譯]
他實際上可能做了大約六個月。當1968年的選舉來臨時，他還沒有走得太遠，然後他參與了一些過渡階段的工作，最終進入了政府。所以羅文要我接手這份工作。我想那應該是在1969年初，因為起初，當施萊辛格在過渡期間回到這裡時，還不知道他是否會回來。最初的預期是他可能會回來。

--- 段落 503 (334 字元) ---
So he [Schlesinger] probably knew about the offer to be assistant director in the Bureau of the Budget and accepted it in, I don’t know,  middle of January, late January, and shortly afterwards Rowen asked me to take  on the thing.And so I looked at—I’m not sure exactly all of what Schlesinger had done, or I  don’t remember exactly.

[翻譯]
因此，他[施萊辛格]很可能知道被提名為預算局助理主任的邀請，並在一月中旬或晚些時候接受了該邀請。不久之後，羅文請我接手這件事。所以我看了一下 - 我不確定施萊辛格具體做了什麼，或者我記不清楚。

--- 段落 504 (461 字元) ---
But anyway, one of the things I did was to get a kind  of a readout of, Well, who is doing work at RAND, and charging it off against, or  claiming that he’s working on strategic nuclear forces?And it was a very motley  assortment, because there had been no overall real direction.And Schlesinger, I think, hadn’t gotten far enough along to really take hold of  this.And so I then started to think about, Well, what should a program in this area  really look at?

[翻譯]
然而，其中一件事是我瞭解到，有人在蘭德公司進行工作，並將其歸因於或聲稱他正從事戰略核力量的工作？這一切都變得雜亂無章，因為沒有整體真正的方向。施萊辛格（Schlesinger）我認為還沒有足夠的進展來真正掌控這個問題。因此，我開始思考，在這個領域，一個真正的計劃應該看起來如何？

--- 段落 505 (366 字元) ---
What are the issues that you would want to have work being done  on?And so on, etc.And then it all kind of came out kind of naturally.And then I  had formed a small kind of discussion and planning group of not everyone who  claimed he was working in this area, but—and I even forget exactly who was on  it, but it was a small group of three or four people, probably.

[翻譯]
你希望進行哪些工作？等等。然後這一切都自然而然地發生了。後來，我組建了一個小型的討論和計劃小組，並非所有聲稱自己在這個領域工作的人都參與其中，但我甚至忘記了確切是誰參加了這個小組，可能是三到四個人。

--- 段落 506 (399 字元) ---
I had these ideas and  tried them out there, and then said, more or less said, Well, here’s the way I think  you really ought to look at this thing.Here’s a—In some sense we’ve been in this  kind of competition in this area for twenty years or more already and it’s going to  go on for a long time and we maybe need to look at it a different way and so on.And so it kind of led to that set of ideas.

[翻譯]
我有這些想法，試著在那裡實踐，然後說，或多或少地說，嗯，這裡是我認為你真的應該看待這件事的方式。在某種程度上，我們在這個領域已經進行了二十年或更長時間的競爭，這種競爭將持續很長時間，也許我們需要以不同的方式來看待它等等，所以它引出了這一套想法。

--- 段落 507 (445 字元) ---
And internally…I don’t know what the records show…My memory is that it…The  whole thing, at least in an early form, was written down by the end of the summer  of ‘69.And then I had this call from Kissinger’s office asking me to stop by, and I  was on my way to a vacation in France.And I stopped by in probably about the  third week of September and had a session with Kissinger and then went on my  way and was gone about a month and came back.

[翻譯]
在內部...我不知道記錄顯示的是什麼...依據我的記憶...整個事情，至少在早期形式下，是在1969年夏天結束時寫下的。然後我接到了基辛格辦公室的電話，要求我順道一下，我當時正在前往法國度假的途中。我在大約九月第三周順道拜訪了基辛格，然後繼續我的旅行，大約一個月後回來。

--- 段落 508 (475 字元) ---
And then when I came back I  continued to try to sort out things on this program, but I was also being badgered  by Kissinger to come back and get on with this study and so on, which I did in the  early part of December of ‘69.- Q1: Do you remember what kind of reaction you got from the Air Force, or from the  small group at RAND that you were meeting with?- Marshall: Well, they…I don’t know…The group at RAND, I mean the people I talked  to, thought that was interesting.

[翻譯]
後來我回來後，繼續嘗試解決這個計畫上的事情，但基辛格也一直在煩我回來繼續進行這項研究等等，這是在1969年12月初時進行的。Q1：您記得空軍或與您會面的蘭德小組對您有何反應嗎？- 馬歇爾：嗯，他們...我不知道...在蘭德的那群人，我指的是我談話的人，覺得這很有趣。

--- 段落 509 (477 字元) ---
But I think it was never particularly picked up or  taken anywhere at RAND.I got several letters and notes from people in the Air  Force who liked it, thought it was interesting.But that’s about it, as I remember.But, as I say, my memory is—  I don’t know whether anything shows up in that summer of ‘69.But essentially  it seems in my own mind a lot of it was done then, or the essence of it had been  worked out.91 But then I went away.Did some more probably when I got back.

[翻譯]
但我認為在蘭德公司這份文件從未特別引起注意或被帶出過。我收到了幾封來自空軍的人的信件和註解，他們喜歡它，認為它很有趣。但就我記得來說，就是這些了。但是，就像我說的，我的記憶或許有些模糊，我不知道69年夏天是否有出現什麼記錄。但基本上，在我自己心中，很多工作當時已經完成，或者至少已經找到了解決方法。但後來我離開了。回來後可能又做了一些工作。

--- 段落 510 (460 字元) ---
And there was also a lot of practical stuff of trying to get the monies allocated,  because I, in principle, now controlled the budget.“In principle,” I say, because  there was not a very effective apparatus for doing that.And then I went away.And then over ‘70, I mean I did the thing for Henry, the two reports, the last report  was finished very early in May.It was essentially the same time as the Cambodian enterprise was started.I then came back to RAND.

[翻譯]
而且還有很多實際的事情需要處理，因為從原則上來說，我現在控制預算。我說“從原則上來說”，因為實際上沒有一個很有效的機構來做這件事。然後我就離開了。之後在70年代，我做了亨利的事情，完成了兩份報告，最後一份報告在五月初完成。基本上是在柬埔寨活動開始的同一時間。然後我回到了 RAND。

--- 段落 511 (468 字元) ---
But then quite soon there was  this…Two things: one, there was the SS-9 study that he accepted, and I ran that,  coming back from time to time and doing it, and then this effort that started in  the summer of ‘70 on these standby programs and the net assessment.And then in December came this direction from Nixon to Henry and Shultz about  the reform of the intelligence community.And that started another cycle of my  commuting back and spending a lot of time there.

[翻譯]
但很快便出現了這樣的情況...有兩件事：一是他接受了SS-9研究，我負責管理這項工作，不時返回並進行，然後在1970年夏天開始的這個待命計劃和網絡評估。然後在十二月，尼克松向亨利和舒爾茨下達了關於情報社區改革的指示。這開始了我另一輪的通勤和花費大量時間在那裡。

--- 段落 512 (303 字元) ---
- Q1: So how much time did you really have to devote to shaping the interdepartmental research program on strategic studies?- Marshall: Well, I mean it was hard, given all of these other things, and probably, you  know—  
- Q1: How did you decide on the topic for the NSSM 186, the first net assessment?

[翻譯]
- Q1：你實際上為塑造跨部門戰略研究計劃花了多少時間？- Marshall：嗯，我是說這很困難，考慮到所有其他事情，也許你知道的——
- Q1：你是如何決定NSSM 186的主題，進行第一次淨評估的？

--- 段落 513 (475 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, we had had a long struggle to get the whole thing going, because  Laird kind of dragged his feet on it, I talked a lot to Buzhardt, and also Laird had as  a special assistant this guy who…I forget his name…Baroody…But I dealt mainly  with Buzhardt, but I had some meetings with Baroody.And both of them, I think, wanted to move ahead or be reasonable, but they—I  never really talked to Laird about it, but I mean he clearly resisted the idea of the  thing.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，我們為了讓整個事情進展艱難地奮鬥了很久，因為萊爾德在這件事上有些拖拖拉拉。我跟布茲哈特多說了一些話，而且萊爾德身邊有一個特別助手，那個人…我忘記他的名字了…巴魯迪…但我主要是與布茲哈特打交道，不過也有一些和巴魯迪見面的機會。我認為他們兩個都希望前進或者變得較為理性，不過他們…我從來沒有真正跟萊爾德討論過這個問題，但我知道他明顯地抗拒這個想法。

--- 段落 514 (407 字元) ---
So in the end, the way the things were going to be done was, while they  would be run from the NSC, the actual work would be farmed out to the most  relevant and interested party.We had a little working group…A guy named Al  Hall, who was here in the Pentagon…  
- Q1: He was like the Assistant Secretary for Intelligence.- Marshall: Yeah.And he also had been involved in this working group, for this NSCIC.

[翻譯]
所以最後，這些事情將要被執行的方式是，雖然它們將由國家安全委員會主導，實際的工作將被分派給最相關且感興趣的一方。我們有一個小工作小組...一個名叫艾爾·霍爾（Al Hall）的男士在五角大廈這裡... 
- Q1: 他就像情報部助理部長一樣。- 馬歇爾：是的。他也參與了這個國家安全委員會情報委員會的工作小組。

--- 段落 515 (496 字元) ---
So when we finally worked out a process that Defense would buy, then came the  question of picking a topic.And I’m not sure exactly why we picked the ground  forces.It may have been, Well, this is an area, let’s just start with it, and some  things probably favored it and so on.More work had been done looking at—not  real net assessments—but looking at the nuclear forces… So, anyway, that ended  up being picked as a reasonable one to start with, and see how this whole thing  was going to go.

[翻譯]
所以當我們終於找到國防部願意採購的流程時，接下來就是挑選一個主題的問題。我不確定我們為什麼挑選地面部隊。可能是因為這是一個領域，讓我們就從這裡開始吧，而且某些因素可能有利於它等等。之前也有更多人在研究 — 並不是真正的淨評估 — 但是會考慮核力量...總之，這最終被選定為一個合理的起點，看看整個事情會如何進行。

--- 段落 516 (396 字元) ---
But it was started very late.It was started probably just…at most six months  before I moved over here.- Q1: In fact, this NSSM 186 is dated 1 September 1973.- Marshall: Hmmm, yeah, right.So anyway, just a few months, right.But probably—It  had been so slow to have the whole thing come together that the people were  more or less in place, and a contract was put out to BDM to do a lot of stuff.

[翻譯]
但是這個計劃開始得很晚。大概就在我搬到這裡前，最多只有六個月時間。- Q1: 實際上，這個NSSM 186 的日期是1973年9月1日。- 馬歇爾：嗯，對。所以，大概就是幾個月的時間。但可能...整個計劃推進得很緩慢，人們或多或少已經到位，一份合同交給BDM公司進行許多工作。

--- 段落 517 (470 字元) ---
That’s  how Phil Karber and all these guys… They had an office down in the basement  someplace here and they got going.- Q1: Now did they do most of the work for the initial ground force net assessment?- Marshall: Well, a lot of it, yeah, right.- Q1: And then they continued after that?- Marshall: Yeah, right.That’s right, that contract.And I took that over and it became  a long-standing contract.- Q1: Do you know when you first started thinking about net assessment?

[翻譯]
這就是Phil Karber和這些人如何... 他們在地下室裡有一個辦公室，然後就開始了。- 問題1：那麼，他們是否為初期地面部隊網絡評估做了大部分工作？- 馬歇爾：嗯，很多，是的，是的。- 問題1：然後之後他們繼續做嗎？- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。是的，那份合同。我接手了，然後它變成了一個長期的合同。- 問題1：您知道您第一次開始考慮網絡評估是什麼時候嗎？

--- 段落 518 (463 字元) ---
- Marshall: I mainly wrote the 1970 net assessment, although Schlesinger spent a  little time on it.And there were people around—I mean, again, Charlie Herzfeld  was around, always pushing the idea of doing it.So I was thinking about it, and I’d  done that earlier paper on measuring military power, and so on.In a more systematic way, it would be for Wikner back in… [when Marshall wrote  his report on comparisons and R&D strategy, part of a larger RAND effort.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我主要撰寫了1970年的網路評估，雖然謝辛格也花了一點時間在這上面。周圍也有人——我的意思是，查理赫茲菲爾德總是在推動這個想法。所以我一直在考慮這個問題，我之前已經寫過有關衡量軍事力量的論文等等。更有系統性地，這是給Wikner回饋的…（當馬歇爾寫他有關比較和研發戰略的報告時，這是RAND的一部分努力中的一部分）。

--- 段落 519 (257 字元) ---
] And at  the time I did not particularly aspire to do that and so on.I thought it was interesting,  important, to try to have some way of measuring the comparative capabilities, and I  clearly didn’t think most of these simplified approaches did very much.

[翻譯]
在那個時候，我並沒有特別渴望這樣做等等。我認為嘗試找到某種方式來衡量相對能力是有趣且重要的，我明顯地認為大多數簡化的方法並不能做出多少貢獻。

--- 段落 520 (376 字元) ---
And I guess  I had—A lot of my interest in it grew out of this interest in the Soviet Union, but  in this organizational assessment, I mean of how much of both what people did,  how effective they were, depended on these organizational matters.But I hadn’t  any, did not envisage, or I wasn’t particularly pushing the idea of setting up an office to do these things and so on.

[翻譯]
我想我對這個的興趣主要源自對蘇聯的興趣，但在這種組織評估中，我意味著人們所做的事情，以及他們的效率有多少取決於這些組織問題。但我並不打算、也沒有預見，或者並沒有特別提出建立一個辦公室來進行這些事情等等。

--- 段落 521 (429 字元) ---
[indistinct] a good idea that somebody ought to  do, but I didn’t—At the time I was far more interested in the intelligence problems  and in this…different ways of looking at these issues of “doing well,” like the longterm competition set of ideas and in this application of these ideas coming out of  an organizational, almost social-cultural kind of perspective on these issues.- Q1: Did you also write a study of possible U.S.

[翻譯]
有個人應該去做的好主意，但我並沒有——當時我對情報問題更感興趣，以及不同角度看待這些"做得好"的議題，例如長期競爭理念集合以及這些理念應用在組織上，幾乎是從社會文化角度來看待這些問題。問題1：您是否也寫了一份可能的美國研究？

responses to Soviet threats against  China with Richard Kennedy while working for Kissinger?- Marshall: It was almost a drafting of a little paper on the thing, appraisal for—Well,  and a recommendation about what we should do, I guess, which I didn’t think I  had any special competence in, but got dragged into by Kennedy.

[翻譯]
與理查德·肯尼迪一起為基辛格工作時，對蘇聯對中國的威脅做出反應-馬歇爾：這幾乎是對這件事情進行一點點草拟，對——評估以及我們應該做些什麼的建議，我想我並沒有特別的專業知識，但被肯尼迪拉進去了。

--- 段落 523 (463 字元) ---
- Q1: In Kissinger’s memoirs, and other sources, he mentions that at this time, early  1970, the NSC was doing a study of contingency planning for what the United  States should do if there were a war between the Soviet Union and China.- Marshall: Yes.- Q1: Now was this small effort that you and Kennedy worked on related to that?- Marshall: Well, I presume it was right at the beginning, because what he and I did, as  I remember, took place in December of ‘69.

[翻譯]
問1：在基辛格的回憶錄和其他資料中提到，當時在1970年初，NSC正在進行一項研究，探討如果蘇聯和中國發生戰爭，美國應該採取什麼樣的應變計劃。- 馬歇爾：是的。- 問1：那麼你和肯尼迪一起努力的這個小計劃是否與此有關？- 馬歇爾：我想應該是在開始階段，因為據我記得，他和我所做的是在1969年12月進行的。

--- 段落 524 (469 字元) ---
I came to kind of start this other stuff,  and was just kind of getting organized to do all of these studies and so on, etc.And this issue came up of the Russian—I don’t know, I forget—approaches to us,  but anyway, threats against the Chinese.- Q1: That was really in the late summer and fall of ‘69.- Marshall: That’s right.But somehow or another it had become an issue just at that  moment.And so, Kennedy indicated to me that Kissinger would like me to participate.

[翻譯]
我開始了這件事情的另一個部分，正在籌備進行所有這些研究等等。然後出現了俄羅斯對我們的威脅的問題，我不記得了，反正就是針對中國的威脅。這大概是在1969年秋天末期。肯尼迪告訴我，基辛格希望我參與其中。

--- 段落 525 (436 字元) ---
So it was kind of like being dragged off to the side, from the main thing I  was there to do, to just think through with him, you know, how should we react, what might we do and so on, and a little paper was prepared, which I participated  in the drafting of.And it was sent into Kissinger, and after that I never knew what  happened.- Q1: But what did you recommend in this short paper?- Marshall: I’m a little vague on that, you know.

[翻譯]
所以有點像是被拖到一邊，離開我本來要做的主要事情，只是和他一起思考，你知道，我們應該如何反應，可以做些什麼等等，並準備了一份小論文，我也參與了起草。然後這份文件被送到基辛格那裡，之後我就不知道發生了什麼事了。 - 問1：但在這份簡短的文件中，您推薦了什麼？- 馬歇爾：對此我有點模糊。

--- 段落 526 (423 字元) ---
But my guess is that one of the things  was, Well, you really ought to start some planning, some thinking what do you  really do if…I think it was kind of to discourage the Russians, but also think about  what you can do.But I don’t have any clear memory of that.- Q1: This is just for completeness.Make sure that what you want to say is in the book.- Marshall: Yes, right.- Q1: Could you talk about your work on deception?

[翻譯]
但我猜想其中一件事情是，嗯，你真的應該開始做一些規劃，一些考慮如果…我想這可能是為了嚇阻俄羅斯人，但也要考慮你可以做些什麼。但我對此並沒有清晰的記憶。- 問題1：這只是為了完整性。確保你想說的在書中有提到。- 馬歇爾：是的，沒錯。- 問題1：你能談談你對欺騙的研究嗎？

--- 段落 527 (360 字元) ---
- Marshall: I’d had this long-term interest in deception as a very important thing.And  probably when I was at the NSC, I forget whether I had any money to do it, but I  encouraged the people out at the Naval Postgraduate School, there were several  people out there who were interested in it, ended up with a—you know there’s a  volume on deception and so on.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：我對欺騙有這個長期的興趣，認為它是一件非常重要的事情。可能在我在NSC時，我不記得是否有資金去做這個事情，但我鼓勵了在海軍研究生院的人們，那裡有幾個人對這個感興趣，最終出現了一本有關欺騙等主題的著作。

--- 段落 528 (358 字元) ---
- Q1: So that grew out of your support for—  
- Marshall: Well encouragement, and then later I think I gave them money, I forget—  Right, yeah.- Q1: Anything else you want to say on that?- Marshall: No.- Q1: Alright.- Marshall: Except that it’s a big, important topic in which the intelligence community has been very slow and resistant to really looking at.

[翻譯]
問1：這是因為您對...的支持而產生的嗎？　　
Marshall：嗯，鼓勵，然後後來我想我給了他們錢，我忘記了，對，對。
問1：您對此還有其他想說的嗎？
Marshall：沒有。
問1：好的。
Marshall：除了這是一個重要的大題目，情報界一直很慢，很抗拒真正去研究這個問題。

--- 段落 529 (363 字元) ---
Not stuff that we would  do, but the fact that other people may do it, and one of the problems in the intelligence world is how to deal with that.It was one of the good things about Casey,  he understood what the real world was like.- Q1: Could you explain the line “Kissinger contrast of Chinese and Soviets” from the  notes for one of your talks on this period?

[翻譯]
並非我們會做的事情，而是其他人可能會做的事情，情報界面臨的問題之一就是如何應對這個問題。這也是凱西懂得實際世界情況的一個好處。Q1：您能解釋一下關於「學者對中國人和蘇聯人的對比」這句話在您談論這一時期的註解中的意思嗎？

--- 段落 530 (325 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, I remember when Kissinger came back from the ‘72—I mean the first  big official one that he went with Nixon… He had a meeting at which he briefed  a number of the people on the NSC.Maybe it was only those who had somehow  been involved in assisting the preparations.And I remember I did a few small  things.

[翻譯]
Marshall: 我記得基辛格從1972年回來時，和尼克松一起參加的第一個大型官方會議... 他召開了一個會議，向一些國家安全會議的人員匯報了情況。也許只有一些在準備工作中有所幫助的人參加了。我記得我做了一些小事。

--- 段落 531 (342 字元) ---
And he made this point about how good it was to deal with the Chinese,  who were, the way he put it, better than their word, as compared with the Soviets,  who are violating the treaty at the same moment they’re signing it.You know, I  mean [Marshall laughs].And also what a contrast…Not much…And also intellectually more interesting, better.

[翻譯]
他指出了與中國人打交道是多麼美好，他說中國人比起蘇聯來說更守信用，就像同時簽署條約卻又違反條約的蘇聯。你知道，我的意思是[馬歇爾笑了]。此外，這也是一個對比…沒有太多…而且在智識上更有趣，更好。

- Q1: Who was the “AF gen” mentioned in the line “Tweedy/Helms reactions/role of  DCI/Intelligence Community staff, AF gen” from the notes for one of your talks on  this period?- Marshall: It may be a reference to Lew Allen, who was the first head of the Intelligence Community Staff and then later head of NSA.Both Schlesinger and I had  come to know him because he had been involved in the NRO space operations  and so on.92  
- Q1: How much contact did you have with Kissinger before 1969?

[翻譯]
問1：在你討論這個時期的一次演講筆記中提到的“AF gen”是指誰？“Tweedy/Helms reactions/role of DCI/Intelligence Community staff, AF gen”- 馬歇爾：這可能是指盧·艾倫，他是情報社區工作人員的首位負責人，後來成為NSA的負責人。舒萊辛格和我們都認識他，因為他曾參與NRO的太空行動等。92
- Q1：在1969年之前，你與基辛格有多少聯繫？

--- 段落 533 (489 字元) ---
- Marshall: Well, one that I—Well, very slim.I met him…He’d come to RAND…I forget  when it would be, probably the late ‘50s.I remember that he had been invited,  and there was a party for him up at the Wohlstetter’s and I remember being there,  shaking his hand and so on.But he’d also been at RAND, I mean that particular  visit, so I presume that would have been in… probably after this book of his in ‘57  [Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy] so it probably was the ‘58–’59 time period.

[翻譯]
馬歇爾：嗯，有一個很瘦小的人。我遇到過他...他來過蘭德公司...我忘記是什麼時候，可能是50年代末。我記得他被邀請來參加Party，當時在沃爾斯特特家裡舉辦了一個Party，我記得當時在那兒，握了他的手等。但他也曾在蘭德公司，我指的是那次參訪，所以我推測那個時間應該是...可能在他的《核武器與外交政策》這本書出版後（1957年），所以應該是1958至1959年之間。

--- 段落 534 (247 字元) ---
But that’s the only two things I can remember.I mean—Right.But I mean I had no  real personal connection with him.- Q1: Can you think anything else about this period you’d like to…?- Marshall: [Laughs] No, I don’t think so.- Q1: I’ve asked enough.

[翻譯]
但這是我唯一能記得的兩件事。我的意思是—對。但是我和他沒有真正的個人聯繫。- Q1: 關於這段時間，你能想到其他任何事情嗎？- 馬歇爾：[笑] 不，我想沒有了。- Q1: 我問得夠了。

### Endnotes 
1 Eds: This chapter includes four sections.The first two draw on consecutive interviews Guthe  conducted with Marshall in 1993 and 1994—the first covers 1969–1975, and is an interview  from 14 December 1993, the second covers 1973–1976, and is excerpted from an interview  from 8 April 1994.The first outline was prepared for the first interview, while the second outline is an excerpt of the relevant sections from the outline prepared for the second interview.

[翻譯]
註腳
1 編輯：本章包含四個部分。前兩個部分是根據古西在1993年和1994年連續進行的採訪編寫的──第一個部分涵蓋了1969年至1975年，是從1993年12月14日的一次採訪中摘錄的，第二個部分則涵蓋了1973年至1976年，是從1994年4月8日的一次採訪中摘錄的。第一個大綱是為第一次採訪準備的，而第二個大綱是從為第二次採訪準備的大綱中抽取的相關部分。

--- 段落 537 (406 字元) ---
The third section is an interview conducted on 13 July 1999, and the fourth section is an interview conducted on 20 July 1999.Both cover 1969–1973.Because the third and fourth sections  draw on follow-up interviews and lack the narrative flow of the original interviews, the editors  have chosen to place them at the end of the chapter even though they cover an earlier time period than the second section.

[翻譯]
第三節是在1999年7月13日進行的訪談，而第四節是在1999年7月20日進行的訪談。兩者都涵蓋了1969年至1973年的內容。由於第三和第四節引用了後續訪談，並且缺乏原始訪談的敘述流暢，編輯們決定將它們放在該章節的末尾，即使它們涵蓋了比第二節更早的時間段。
